During June–October 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 sublineage accounted for most of the sequenced viral genomes in the United States, with further Omicron sublineage diversification through November 2022.* Bivalent mRNA vaccines contain an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain component plus an updated component of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages. On September 1, 2022, a single bivalent booster dose was recommended for adults who had completed a primary vaccination series (with or without subsequent booster doses), with the last dose administered ≥2 months earlier (1). During September 13–November 18, the VISION Network evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a bivalent mRNA booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) compared with 1) no previous vaccination and 2) previous receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years with an emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounter or hospitalization for a COVID-19–like illness.† VE of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters was 56% compared with no vaccination, 32% compared with monovalent vaccination only with last dose 2–4 months earlier, and 50% compared with monovalent vaccination only with last dose ≥11 months earlier. VE of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) against COVID-19–associated hospitalizations was 59% compared with no vaccination, 42% compared with monovalent vaccination only with last dose 5–7 months earlier, and 48% compared with monovalent vaccination only with last dose ≥11 months earlier. Bivalent vaccines administered after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses were effective in preventing medically attended COVID-19 compared with no vaccination and provided additional protection compared with past monovalent vaccination only, with relative protection increasing with time since receipt of the last monovalent dose. All eligible persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, including receiving a bivalent booster dose. Persons should also consider taking additional precautions to avoid respiratory illness this winter season, such as masking in public indoor spaces, especially in areas where COVID-19 community levels are high.

Monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were developed against the spike protein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus and were found to provide cross-reactive immune protection against Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants (2). The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged in November 2021 and diversified into sublineages. These Omicron sublineages were associated with decreased protection from vaccination with monovalent vaccine (3). A single booster dose of bivalent mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) containing an updated BA.4/BA.5 component was recommended by CDC on September 1, 2022, (1) for adults who had completed a primary series with any Food and Drug Administration–approved or –authorized monovalent vaccine or who had previously received a monovalent booster dose ≥2 months earlier.§

The VISION Network¶ evaluated the effectiveness of a bivalent booster dose among immunocompetent adults during September 13–November 18, 2022, a period during which the Omicron BA.5 sublineage predominated and additional Omicron sublineages emerged. Seven health systems in nine states contributed data for this analysis. VISION methods have been described (3). Briefly, ED/UC encounters and hospitalizations associated with a COVID-19–like illness among adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result during the 14 days before through 72 hours after the encounter were included.** Patients were classified as unvaccinated (zero doses received), vaccinated with 2, 3, or 4 doses of a monovalent-only mRNA vaccine, or vaccinated with 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses plus a bivalent booster dose ≥60 days after receipt of their last monovalent dose. Encounters were excluded if 1) the patient likely had an immunocompromising condition (4); 2) only one mRNA monovalent vaccine dose was received, a second monovalent vaccine dose was received <14 days before the encounter date, or a third or fourth monovalent vaccine dose or a bivalent booster dose was received <7 days before the encounter date; 3) any dose of a non-mRNA vaccine (e.g., Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) was received; or 4) a vaccine dose was received before being recommended by CDC.†† VE was estimated using a test-negative case-control design, comparing the odds of having received versus having not received a bivalent booster dose among case-patients (those who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result) and control patients (those who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result).

Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day (days since January 1, 2021), geographic region, and local SARS-CoV-2 circulation (percentage of SARS-CoV-2–positive results from testing within the counties surrounding the facility on the date of the encounter). Age, calendar day, and local circulation were modeled as natural cubic splines. A single, combined model was fit for each outcome (ED/UC encounters and hospitalizations) with those who had received a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) as the referent group with the following vaccination groups: those who had received no vaccine doses (unvaccinated) (i.e., absolute VE) and those who had received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses but not a bivalent booster dose (i.e., relative VE). Varying time intervals between the last dose and the index date (2–4, 5–7, 8–10, or ≥11 months)§§ were used to calculate relative VE. Analyses were conducted using R (version 4.2.2; R Foundation). This study was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy and was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards at participating sites or under reliance agreement with the Institutional Review Board of Westat, Inc.¶¶

Among 78,170 ED/UC encounters with COVID-19–like illness that met inclusion criteria, 8,986 (12%) case-patients and 69,184 (89%) control patients were identified (Table 1). Overall, 24,130 (31%) were unvaccinated. Among persons who had not received a bivalent dose, 18,724 (24%), 22,539 (29%), and 8,080 (10%) had received 2, 3, and 4 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine, respectively. Among the 4,697 (6%) adults who had received a bivalent booster dose (median interval since receipt of bivalent booster dose = 25 days), 292 (6%) had received 2 monovalent doses, 2,115 (45%) had received 3 monovalent doses, and 2,290 (49%) had received 4 monovalent vaccine doses. Bivalent booster dose recipients were older (median age = 68 years) than were those who had not received a bivalent booster dose (median age = 55 years). VE of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) against ED/UC encounters for COVID-19–associated illness was 56% (95% CI = 50%–61%) compared with no vaccination, 32% (95% CI = 21%–42%) compared with receipt of last monovalent dose 2–4 months earlier, and 50% (95% CI = 44%–56%) compared with receipt of last monovalent dose ≥11 months earlier (Table 2).

Among 15,502 hospitalizations with COVID-19–like illness that met inclusion criteria, 1,452 (9%) case-patients and 14,050 (91%) control patients were identified (Table 3). Overall, 4,092 (26%) were unvaccinated. Among those who had not received a bivalent dose, 3,343 (22%), 4,704 (30%), and 2,479 (16%) had received 2, 3, and 4 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine, respectively. Among the 884 (6%) adults who had received a bivalent booster dose (median interval since receipt of bivalent booster dose = 23 days), 58 (7%) had received 2 monovalent doses, 299 (34%) had received 3 monovalent doses, and 527 (60%) had received 4 monovalent doses. Bivalent booster dose recipients were similar in age to vaccinated adults who had not received a bivalent booster dose (median age = 76 and 73 years, respectively). VE of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) against hospitalization for COVID-19–associated illness was 59% (95% CI = 44%–70%) compared with no vaccination and 48% (95% CI = 30%–62%) compared with receipt of last monovalent doses, with last dose ≥11 months earlier (Table 2).","Discussion

Analysis of data from the multistate VISION Network found that during September–November 2022, when the BA.5 and other Omicron sublineages were the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States, bivalent booster doses (after receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) were effective in preventing medically attended COVID-19 compared with no previous vaccination among immunocompetent adults and provided additional protection when compared with previous monovalent mRNA vaccine doses only. VE was similar against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters and hospitalizations, which might reflect changing severity of hospitalized cases over time (5). Additional studies are needed to evaluate VE against outcomes such as COVID-19–associated severe respiratory illness or death. The IVY Network, an adult inpatient VE network, recently found higher estimated VE in adults aged ≥65 years compared with estimates for those aged ≥18 years included in this analysis (6). This might reflect differences in population subgroups evaluated. Long-term durability of bivalent booster vaccination protection also could not be assessed because of the short period of observation since bivalent dose receipt. In a recent analysis from VISION, during BA.4/BA.5–predominant circulation, 3-dose monovalent VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was observed to wane from 68% at 7–119 days after vaccination to 36% at ≥120 days (5). This might explain why, among patients who had received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses only, a longer interval since the most recent dose was associated with more relative protection after receipt of the bivalent booster dose.

Bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines were developed to improve protection against circulating Omicron sublineages because of immune escape potentially associated with these subvariants and waning of monovalent vaccine-conferred protection over time (7). Real-world data suggest that bivalent boosters provide a modest degree of protection against symptomatic infection among adults compared with receipt of 2, 3, or 4 doses of monovalent vaccines only (8). Results from this study also demonstrate protection against ED/UC encounters and hospitalization during a period when BA.5 and other Omicron sublineage viruses predominated in the United States. With co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, vaccination against respiratory diseases for which vaccines are available is especially important to prevent illnesses resulting in health care encounters and to reduce strain on the health care system (9). Additional studies will be critical to evaluating the durability of added protection, especially with circulation of sublineages of the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron variants such as BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.

The findings in this study are subject to at least six limitations. First, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was not accounted for in this analysis. A large proportion of the population has now experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection which decreases the risk of future medically attended COVID-19 illness and might affect observed VE due to background immunity (10). Second, although models adjusted for relevant confounders, residual confounding is possible, including by behavioral differences and use of COVID-19 treatments such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). Third, sublineage-specific VE could not be estimated. Fourth, this analysis did not compare product-specific bivalent booster VE estimates. Fifth, relative VE was estimated using the interval since receipt of last monovalent dose; this study was not statistically powered to estimate whether relative VE differed by number of previous monovalent vaccine doses received. Finally, because these data are from nine states, the patients in this analysis might not be representative of the entire population of the United States. Further, this analysis included adults who received bivalent booster doses shortly after authorization who might not be fully representative of the vaccine-eligible population. For example, over one half of bivalent booster recipients had previously received 4 monovalent vaccine doses. Additional VE studies are needed as coverage of bivalent boosters increases.

In this early study of immunocompetent adults, significant protection from a booster dose of bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (after receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) compared with no vaccination was found, as well as significant relative benefits of a bivalent booster dose when compared with previous receipt of monovalent doses only. These findings support efforts to improve coverage with bivalent vaccines, although optimal timing for receipt of bivalent vaccine booster doses needs to be established. All eligible persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, including receiving a bivalent booster dose. In addition, persons should consider taking other precautions to avoid respiratory illness this winter season, including masking in public indoor spaces, especially in areas where COVID-19 community levels are high, to protect themselves and others and reduce strain on the health care system during an ongoing surge in multiple respiratory viruses.","Corresponding author: Mark W.

Transgender and gender-diverse persons, who constitute an estimated 0.5% of the U.S. adult population,† face unique health disparities and barriers to care (2–4). However, data on the epidemiologic and clinical features of Monkeypox virus infections in this population are limited (5). CDC analyzed U.S. case surveillance data on mpox cases in transgender and gender-diverse adults reported during May 17–November 4, 2022. During this period, 466 mpox cases in transgender and gender-diverse adults were reported, accounting for 1.7% of reported cases among adults. Most were in transgender women (43.1%) or gender-diverse persons (42.1%); 14.8% were in transgender men. Among 374 (80.3%) mpox cases in transgender and gender-diverse adults with information available on sexual or close intimate contact, 276 (73.8%) reported sexual or close intimate contact with a cisgender male partner during the 3 weeks preceding symptom onset. During the ongoing outbreak, transgender and gender-diverse persons have been disproportionately affected by mpox. Members of this population frequently reported recent sexual or close intimate contact with cisgender men, who might be in sexual networks experiencing the highest incidence of mpox. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring public health prevention and outreach efforts to transgender and gender-diverse communities and could guide strategies to reduce mpox transmission.

Data on confirmed and probable cases of mpox are electronically reported by jurisdictional health departments to CDC using a standardized case report form§ or the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.¶ CDC analyzed case report form data for persons aged ≥18 years with probable or confirmed mpox reported through November 4, 2022. CDC identified persons as transgender or gender-diverse if their self-reported gender** was transgender or “another gender identity” (i.e., not cisgender or transgender); in addition, persons whose self-reported gender identity differed from their assigned sex at birth were considered transgender.†† This descriptive analysis included demographic and epidemiologic characteristics, exposure characteristics, symptoms, HIV status, and hospitalization status. Data were stratified by gender identity. Because of the high level of missingness of some variables, statistical testing was not performed. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§

As of November 4, 2022, a total of 28,072 cases of mpox had been reported in U.S. adults, primarily among cisgender men (94.8%); 2.6% of cases occurred in cisgender women (Table 1). A total of 466 (1.7%) adults with mpox were transgender or gender-diverse; among these persons, most were transgender women (43.1%) or gender-diverse persons (42.1%); 14.8% were transgender men. A total of 223 persons with missing age were excluded. Among 157 (80.1%) cases in gender-diverse adults with available data on assigned sex at birth, 151 (96.2%) were assigned male sex at birth.

Overall, approximately 52.1% of cases in transgender and gender-diverse adults were reported from New York City (26.0%) or California (26.2%). The median age of transgender and gender-diverse adults with mpox was 32 years (range = 18–71 years) (Table 2). Among the 416 (89.3%) transgender and gender-diverse adults with mpox for whom race and ethnicity were reported, 37.0% of cases occurred in Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic)¶¶ persons, 28.1% in non-Hispanic White persons, 27.6% in non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons, and the remainder in persons of another race or ethnicity. The racial and ethnic distribution among transgender and gender-diverse persons with mpox was generally similar to that among cisgender persons.

Among 374 (80.3%) transgender and gender-diverse adults with sexual and close intimate contact information available, 316 (84.5%) reported engaging in any sexual or close intimate contact during the 3 weeks preceding symptom onset, including 276 (73.8%) who reported sexual or close intimate contact with a cisgender man (261 had exclusively cisgender men as partners, and 15 had partners who included cisgender men and persons of other genders). Ten (2.7%) transgender and gender-diverse adults with mpox reported exclusive sexual or close intimate contact with partners who were not cisgender men. Similarly, among 16,518 (60.4%) cisgender adults with this information available, 13,556 (82.1%) reported engaging in sex or close intimate contact during the 3 weeks before symptom onset, most often with a cisgender man.

The most frequently reported signs and symptoms reported by transgender and gender-diverse adults with mpox included rash (91.8%), malaise (67.3%), fever (64.9%), pruritis (63.9%), headache (63.7%), chills (62.2%) myalgia (61.9%), and enlarged lymph nodes (58.9%). Among 166 (35.6%) transgender and gender-diverse adult mpox patients with data available on HIV status, 79 (47.6%) had HIV infection, including 34 of 57 (59.6%) transgender women, six of 21 (28.6%) transgender men, and 39 of 88 (44.3%) gender-diverse persons. HIV prevalence among cisgender adults with mpox with available data was 55.1%. Among 306 transgender and gender-diverse adults with hospitalization data, 21 (6.9%) were hospitalized, similar to 6.5% of cisgender adults with available data. Among the 21 transgender and gender-diverse persons who were hospitalized, nine (43%) were transgender women, seven (33%) were gender-diverse persons, and five (24%) were transgender men. To date, no mpox-associated deaths have been reported among the transgender or gender-diverse adults identified in this analysis.","Discussion

Mpox cases among transgender and gender-diverse adults have accounted for 1.7% of total U.S. cases. Based on the estimated percentage of U.S. adults who identify as transgender or gender-diverse (0.5%), this population has been overrepresented among mpox cases during the ongoing outbreak (2). Among transgender and gender-diverse persons with available sexual and close intimate contact information, a commonly reported potential exposure was recent sexual or close intimate contact with a cisgender man (73.8%); these cisgender men might be in sexual networks experiencing the highest prevalence of mpox (1). These findings are similar to those from an analysis of mpox cases occurring in 62 transgender women in Europe and the Americas during May–October 2022 (6); in that study, the likeliest route of transmission for most transgender women (89%) was sexual contact, with a majority reporting having had a male sexual partner during the preceding month.

Similar to cisgender adults with mpox, Hispanic (37.0%) and Black (27.6%) transgender and gender-diverse persons were disproportionately represented among mpox cases compared with the racial and ethnic percentage distribution of the overall U.S. population.*** Unique health disparities and barriers to prevention and care faced by transgender and gender-diverse persons might be exacerbated by racial and ethnic health disparities (3,4). Ensuring the prioritization of eligible transgender and gender-diverse persons for mpox vaccination, expanding community engagement and outreach to improve prevention messages, and ensuring equity in approaches to mpox testing, treatment, and prevention strategies are critical public health priorities.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data on certain variables such as symptoms reported, HIV status, hospitalization status, and exposure information were frequently missing in national case surveillance data. Recent sexual and close intimate contact information was missing for approximately one in five cases in transgender and gender-diverse persons, and among those with available information, approximately one in four did not report recent sexual or close intimate contact with a cisgender man. These missing data limit the ability to fully characterize the epidemiologic and clinical features of transgender and gender-diverse persons with mpox. In-depth collection of accurate exposure information is vital to understanding how persons without recent sexual or close intimate contact with cisgender men are likely being exposed to mpox virus, which could guide expanded prevention messaging. Second, methods for collecting sex and gender information are not standardized across all U.S. states and territories. Self-reported gender or sex assigned at birth were missing for 10,370 (36.9%) adults, and for these persons, gender identity was presumed to be cisgender unless gender identity was reported as transgender or another gender identity. This limitation could have resulted in undercounting persons who identify as transgender or gender-diverse, particularly in jurisdictions that do not routinely collect information about transgender and gender-diverse identities. Finally, in the absence of available data on sex assigned at birth, current sex might have been reported, potentially leading to misclassification of gender identity. Improving collection of data on transgender and gender-diverse persons, such as standardizing approaches to collection of sex and gender information and routinely capturing the diversity of gender identities, is important to better understanding and addressing health inequities.

This analysis found that transgender and gender-diverse adults have been experiencing a disproportionate prevalence of Monkeypox virus infections, particularly among those who are Hispanic and Black. Meeting the unique health needs and addressing barriers to prevention and care faced by many transgender and gender-diverse persons is a critical public health priority, particularly during the current mpox outbreak. Adequately addressing the needs of this population will require standardized collection of data on sex and gender identity. Tailoring public health prevention and outreach efforts to transgender and gender-diverse communities, including the prioritization of eligible transgender and gender-diverse persons for mpox vaccination and expanding community engagement efforts, might reduce the disproportionate prevalence of mpox among this population.","Corresponding author: Dawn Blackburn, DBlackburn@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Blackburn D, Roth NM, Gold JA, et al.

However, vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19–associated hospitalization has declined over time, likely related to a combination of factors, including waning immunity and, with the emergence of the Omicron variant and its sublineages, immune evasion (3). To address these factors, on September 1, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended a bivalent COVID-19 mRNA booster (bivalent booster) dose, developed against the spike protein from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages, for persons who had completed at least a primary COVID-19 vaccination series (with or without monovalent booster doses) ≥2 months earlier (4). Data on the effectiveness of a bivalent booster dose against COVID-19 hospitalization in the United States are lacking, including among older adults, who are at highest risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness. During September 8–November 30, 2022, the Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY) Network§ assessed effectiveness of a bivalent booster dose received after ≥2 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine against COVID-19–associated hospitalization among immunocompetent adults aged ≥65 years. When compared with unvaccinated persons, VE of a bivalent booster dose received ≥7 days before illness onset (median = 29 days) against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was 84%. Compared with persons who received ≥2 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, relative VE of a bivalent booster dose was 73%. These early findings show that a bivalent booster dose provided strong protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization in older adults and additional protection among persons with previous monovalent-only mRNA vaccination. All eligible persons, especially adults aged ≥65 years, should receive a bivalent booster dose to maximize protection against COVID-19 hospitalization this winter season. Additional strategies to prevent respiratory illness, such as masking in indoor public spaces, should also be considered, especially in areas where COVID-19 community levels are high (4,5).

During September 8–November 30, 2022, adults aged ≥65 years admitted for COVID-19–like illness¶ to any of 22 hospitals in 18 states participating in the IVY Network were eligible for inclusion in this test-negative design, case-control analysis. Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19–like illness who received testing for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification test or antigen test, those who received a positive test result ≤10 days after illness onset and ≤3 days after hospital admission were classified as case-patients, and those who received a negative test result during the same interval were classified as control patients. Upper respiratory specimens were collected from enrolled patients and retested by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza at a central laboratory (Vanderbilt University Medical Center). Patients who were initially enrolled as controls on the basis of negative SARS-CoV-2 test results at their local hospital, but whose test results by central laboratory testing were positive, were reclassified as case-patients in the analysis. Control patients whose influenza test results were positive were excluded from the analysis because of potential correlation between COVID-19 and influenza vaccination behaviors (6).

Demographic and clinical data were obtained through electronic medical record (EMR) review and patient (or proxy) interview. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination status was verified from EMR, state-based registries, vaccination cards, or self-report. Three COVID-19 vaccination groups were defined as: 1) unvaccinated (no COVID-19 vaccine doses received); 2) vaccinated with ≥2 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses with last dose ≥2 months before illness onset; and 3) vaccinated with ≥2 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses plus a bivalent booster dose ≥2 months after receipt of the last monovalent mRNA vaccine dose. Analyses excluded patients with immunocompromising conditions,** those who received a bivalent booster dose <7 days before illness onset or ≤2 months after their last monovalent vaccine dose, those who received a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, and those with other exclusions.††

Absolute VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was estimated by comparing the odds of bivalent booster dose receipt with no COVID-19 vaccination between case-patients and control patients. Relative VE, which is a measure of the additional protection against COVID-19 hospitalization from a bivalent booster dose compared with residual protection from previous monovalent vaccination, was estimated by comparing the odds of bivalent booster vaccination with receipt of ≥2 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses between case-patients and control patients. Relative VE was stratified by number of months (i.e., 2–5, 6–11, or ≥12) between the last monovalent vaccine dose and illness onset. Using multivariable logistic regression models, VE was estimated as (1 − adjusted odds ratio [aOR]) x 100). Models were adjusted for U.S. Department of Health and Human Services region, admission date in 2-week intervals, continuous age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) ethnicity. Estimates with nonoverlapping 95% CIs were considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was determined to be public health surveillance by each participating site and CDC, and was conducted consistent with all applicable federal laws and CDC policy.§§

During September 8–November 30, 2022, a total of 1,168 immunocompetent adults aged ≥65 years were enrolled in the IVY Network. After exclusion of 370 patients,¶¶ 798 (68%) were included in this analysis (381 case-patients and 417 control patients) (Table 1). The median age of included patients was 76 years (IQR = 70–83 years), 118 (15%) were non-Hispanic Black or African American, 78 (10%) were Hispanic, 588 (74%) had at least two underlying conditions, and 66 (8%) had self-reported or documented SARS-CoV-2 infection before the current illness episode during the Omicron period (December 26, 2021–November 30, 2022). Among the 381 case-patients, 81 (21%) were unvaccinated, 280 (73%) had received ≥2 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, and 20 (5%) had received a bivalent booster dose. Among 417 control patients, 62 (15%) were unvaccinated, 296 (71%) had received ≥2 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, and 59 (14%) had received a bivalent booster dose.

The median interval between receipt of a bivalent booster dose and illness onset was 29 days (IQR = 15–45 days) (Table 2). When compared with unvaccinated patients, VE of a bivalent booster dose in preventing COVID-19–associated hospitalization was 84%. When compared with patients who had received ≥2 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses ≥2 months before illness onset, relative VE of a bivalent booster dose was 73%. When compared with patients whose last monovalent dose was 6–11 months and ≥12 months before illness onset, relative VE of a bivalent booster dose was 78% and 83%, respectively. Small sample size precluded estimation of the relative VE of a bivalent booster dose compared with receipt of ≥2 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses with last dose 2–5 months before illness onset.***","Discussion

Among immunocompetent adults aged ≥65 years hospitalized within the IVY Network in 18 states, a bivalent booster dose received after ≥2 monovalent mRNA doses provided strong protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization during a period of Omicron BA.5 or BQ.1/BQ.1.1 predominance (7). Substantial additional protection from a bivalent booster dose was observed when compared with remote monovalent-only mRNA vaccination, which suggests important incremental benefit for persons eligible to receive a bivalent vaccine booster. These early findings from a cohort of adults aged ≥65 years, 74% of whom had multiple underlying conditions, are among the first to document real-world evidence that receipt of a bivalent booster dose after completion of at least a primary COVID-19 mRNA vaccination series is protective against COVID-19 hospitalization. Continued monitoring will be important to understand ongoing protection in the context of expanding Omicron sublineages and new emerging variants, as well as whether waning of bivalent vaccine-induced immunity over time is observed, similar to that seen after monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine booster doses.

Recent findings from the United Kingdom and the United States have also demonstrated protection of a bivalent mRNA booster dose against COVID-19 hospitalization (8,9). The bivalent mRNA booster vaccine used in the United Kingdom contains spike protein mRNA from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 plus Omicron BA.1, in contrast to the bivalent booster vaccines used in the United States, which contain mRNA from ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron BA.4/BA.5. In the United Kingdom, among adults aged ≥50 years or those in clinical risk groups, a BA.1 bivalent booster dose was found to have a relative VE of 57% (95% CI = 48%–65%) compared with ≥2 COVID-19 vaccine doses received ≥6 months earlier (8). Similarly, a report among adults aged ≥18 years from the VISION Network in the United States using BA.4/BA.5 bivalent booster doses showed a relative VE of 42% (95% CI = 19%–58%) against COVID-19–associated hospitalization compared with ≥2 monovalent COVID-19 vaccine doses received 8–10 months earlier (9). Overall, these results were similar to the relative VE findings in the current study, suggesting that bivalent booster doses provide important benefits.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the sample size was not sufficient to estimate VE by the number of COVID-19 monovalent vaccine doses received before the bivalent booster dose or compared with patients whose most recent monovalent vaccine dose was received 2–5 months before illness onset. Second, because use of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as a booster dose is no longer authorized in the United States,††† this analysis could not compare the effectiveness of a bivalent booster dose with a monovalent booster dose administered during the same period. Third, the analysis period includes both BA.5- and BQ.1/BQ.1.1–predominant periods; therefore, variant-specific VE could not be evaluated. Fourth, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron period was rarely reported or documented among patients in this analysis, which prevented evaluation of the impact of previous infection on VE. Finally, selection bias and residual confounding bias cannot be excluded, including from risk behaviors or preventive treatments.

These early findings from a multistate network show that among adults aged ≥65 years, many of whom have multiple comorbid conditions and who are at highest risk of severe COVID-19, recent bivalent booster vaccination offers substantial added protection against COVID-19 hospitalization. Although prevention of COVID-19 hospitalizations is a core goal of the U.S. vaccination program, bivalent booster dose coverage in the United States remains low among adults aged ≥18 years (16%) and adults aged ≥65 years (36%) (10). Increasing bivalent booster coverage among eligible U.S. adults has the potential to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations as COVID-19 incidence and transmission increase. All eligible persons, especially adults aged ≥65 years, should receive a bivalent booster dose to maximize protection against COVID-19 hospitalization this winter season. Additional strategies to prevent respiratory illness, such as masking in indoor public spaces, should also be considered, especially in areas where COVID-19 community levels are high (4,5).","Corresponding author: Diya Surie, media@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Surie D, DeCuir J, Zhu Y, et al.

What is already known about this topic?

Evidence suggests that 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine offers some protection against monkeypox (mpox).

What is added by this report?

Analysis of mpox infections among unvaccinated persons and those who had received 1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose ≥14 days before illness onset found that the odds of fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, and chills were significantly lower among vaccinated patients than among unvaccinated patients. Overall, 2% of vaccinated persons with mpox and 8% of unvaccinated patients were hospitalized.

What are the implications for public health practice?

One dose of JYNNEOS vaccine might attenuate the severity of illness and reduce hospitalization in persons who become infected after vaccination; however, to optimize protection, all eligible persons are recommended to complete the 2-dose vaccination series. As of November 14, 2022, monkeypox (mpox) cases had been reported from more than 110 countries, including 29,133 cases in the United States.* Among U.S. cases to date, 95% have occurred among males (1). After the first confirmed U.S. mpox case on May 17, 2022, limited supplies of JYNNEOS vaccine (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic) were made available to jurisdictions for persons exposed to mpox. JYNNEOS vaccine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 as a 2-dose series (0.5 mL per dose, administered subcutaneously) to prevent smallpox and mpox disease.† On August 9, 2022, FDA issued an emergency use authorization to allow administration of JYNNEOS vaccine by intradermal injection (0.1 mL per dose) (2). A previous report on U.S. mpox cases during July 31–September 3, 2022, suggested that 1 dose of vaccine offers some protection against mpox (3). This report describes demographic and clinical characteristics of cases occurring ≥14 days after receipt of 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine and compares them with characteristics of cases among unvaccinated persons with mpox and with the vaccine-eligible vaccinated population in participating jurisdictions. During May 22–September 3, 2022, among 14,504 mpox cases reported from 29 participating U.S. jurisdictions,§ 6,605 (45.5%) had available vaccination information and were included in the analysis. Among included cases, 276 (4.2%) were among persons who had received 1 dose of vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset. Mpox cases that occurred in these vaccinated persons were associated with lower percentage of hospitalization (2.1% versus 7.5%), fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, and chills, compared with cases in unvaccinated persons. Although 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine offers some protection from disease, mpox infection can occur after receipt of 1 dose, and the duration of protection conferred by 1 dose is unknown. Providers and public health officials should therefore encourage persons at risk for acquiring mpox to complete the 2-dose vaccination series and provide guidance and education regarding nonvaccine-related prevention strategies (4).

Probable and confirmed mpox cases¶ among persons with illness onset during May 22–September 3, 2022, in the 29 jurisdictions were eligible for inclusion. Persons who had received 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset were considered vaccinated for the purposes of this study**; those who had not received 1 vaccine dose during the current outbreak or who reported illness onset before receipt of their first vaccine dose were considered unvaccinated. Cases were excluded if 1) no vaccination date or vaccination status was available, 2) receipt of vaccine occurred before May 2022, or 3) illness onset occurred ≤13 days after receipt of 1 vaccine dose.

Participating jurisdictions collected data using a standardized data collection form†† including self-reported demographic characteristics, vaccination history, medical history, and possible exposures. Participating jurisdictions linked vaccination data from immunization registries when available or by self-report during case investigation and transmitted the linked data to CDC.

Demographic characteristics of persons with mpox who had received 1 vaccine dose (i.e., were vaccinated) were compared with those of unvaccinated persons with mpox. In addition, characteristics of persons with mpox who were vaccinated were compared with those of all vaccine-eligible persons who were vaccinated, irrespective of case status; these data were obtained through jurisdictional immunization registries reporting first doses administered. Comparisons were made using Pearson’s chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test as appropriate. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

To assess differences in illness among vaccinated and unvaccinated persons with mpox, clinical characteristics were compared between these two groups among persons with data reported for one or more clinical symptoms. Missing individual symptom data were imputed as “no” when there was evidence that the reporting jurisdiction collected symptom data in a “check-all-that-apply” format.§§ Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated to compare clinical characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated mpox patients. Persons with missing data for relevant variables of interest were excluded from individual analyses.

Because JYNNEOS vaccine was administered for postexposure prophylaxis at the beginning of the outbreak, and because the mpox incubation period can be as long as 21 days, a sensitivity analysis including only persons with mpox who received 1 vaccine dose ≥22 days before illness onset as the vaccinated group was conducted. SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.0.3; R Foundation) were used to conduct all analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶

During May 22, 2022–September 3, 2022, a total of 14,504 mpox cases were reported in the 29 included jurisdictions. Among the 6,605 (45.5%) persons with mpox who had available information and who were included in the analysis,*** 6,329 (95.8%) were unvaccinated, and 276 (4.2%) had illness onset ≥14 days after receiving 1 vaccine dose (Table 1). Among vaccinated patients, the median interval from vaccination to illness onset was 23 days (IQR = 17.5–30 days). The age distribution differed for vaccinated mpox patients compared with the vaccine-eligible population identified through immunization registries (p<0.001), but not compared with unvaccinated mpox patients (p = 0.07); 91.2% of vaccinated mpox patients were aged 18–49 years. Overall, 68.2% of vaccinated mpox patients and 49.9% of unvaccinated mpox patients reported White race, whereas 12.4% and 30.9% of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, respectively, reported Black or African American race (p<0.001). Among 345,220 vaccine-eligible persons in the population who had received 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine, a significantly smaller percentage identified as White (46.7%) compared with vaccinated mpox patients (62.8%; p = 0.02). Overall, 259 (98.1%) vaccinated and 5,710 (96.1%) unvaccinated mpox cases occurred in persons identifying as male.

Information on at least one clinical finding was available for 202 (73.2%) of 276 vaccinated persons with mpox and 5,326 (84.2%) of 6,329 unvaccinated mpox patients. Among those who were vaccinated, the most commonly reported signs and symptoms were rash (96.5%), pruritis (33.5%), and enlarged lymph nodes (31.6%) (Table 2). Among unvaccinated persons, the most common signs and symptoms were rash (97.3%), fever (46.5%), and malaise (43.0%). The odds of fever, headache, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting or nausea, myalgia, and chills were significantly lower among vaccinated than among unvaccinated patients (Figure). Odds of rectal signs and symptoms (e.g., proctitis, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, and rectal pain) were similar among vaccinated and unvaccinated mpox patients.

Among both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, the genital area was the rash location most commonly reported (55.0% of vaccinated patients and 46.7% of unvaccinated patients) (Table 2). The odds of reporting rash in all other locations except the perianal area were significantly lower among vaccinated than among unvaccinated patients. The median number of rash locations reported by vaccinated patients (two) was significantly lower than that reported by unvaccinated patients (three) (p<0.001). Among 129 persons with mpox who received 1 vaccine dose ≥22 days before illness onset, demographic and clinical findings were not different from those in persons who had received vaccine ≥14 days earlier.

Among 3,142 unvaccinated persons with mpox, 237 (7.5%) were hospitalized compared with two (2.1%) of 95 vaccinated mpox patients (odds ratio = 0.27; 95% CI = 0.06–1.09). No deaths were reported in either group.","Discussion

In this analysis of 276 mpox cases in persons who received 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset and 6,329 cases in unvaccinated persons during the 2022 U.S. outbreak, vaccinated patients reported signs and symptoms similar to those described earlier in the outbreak (1); however, some symptoms were reported less frequently among vaccinated than among unvaccinated mpox patients. In addition, the percentage of vaccinated patients who were hospitalized (2%) was lower than that among unvaccinated patients (8%), and the odds of systemic signs and symptoms, such as fever and chills, were lower among vaccinated patients. These findings indicate that 1 dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine might attenuate the severity of mpox illness in persons who are infected after vaccination.

The frequent presentation of rash in the genital and perianal areas among both vaccinated and unvaccinated mpox patients suggests that sexual transmission in this population was a common mechanism of transmission. The fewer number of reported rash locations among vaccinated patients suggests possible prevention of spread of rash from site of inoculation among even partially vaccinated persons.

The predominance of White persons among vaccinated mpox patients compared with unvaccinated patients reflects the ongoing racial and ethnic disparities in receipt of the JYNNEOS vaccine nationwide (5,6) and could indicate differential access to or acceptance of the vaccine. Disparities in access to health care and additional treatment options could also have played a role in decreasing the severity of illness in vaccinated White persons.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, 47% of cases were excluded because of missing vaccination information; therefore, results might not be generalizable to all persons with mpox in the United States. Second, persons with mpox who received vaccine outside of their respective jurisdictions of residence might not have had documentation of vaccine receipt, which could lead to potential undercounting of cases among vaccinated persons (7), although many jurisdictions did report sharing vaccination data with one another (Sarah Gillani, MPH, District of Columbia Department of Health, personal communication, September 2022). Third, self-reported doses were included to optimize ascertainment of vaccination status, but self-report is less accurate than documented vaccine receipt and could result in misclassification of vaccination status. Finally, clinical data were not available for all cases. In particular, HIV status was unknown or missing for two thirds of vaccinated and more than one half of unvaccinated patients. Because HIV infection might affect the trajectory and illness severity, future studies with additional data for real-world use of JYNNEOS vaccine against clinical outcomes, including data on HIV history, are needed.

The more limited distribution of rash and reduced severity of illness among persons who had mpox after receiving 1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose supports the potential benefit of vaccination on attenuation of disease. Although infection ≥14 days after receipt of 1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose is infrequent, the occurrence of such cases and the unknown duration of protection conferred by 1 vaccine dose highlights the need for providers and public health officials to encourage completion of the 2-dose vaccination series among persons at risk and continue to provide guidance and education regarding nonvaccine-related prevention strategies (4) until optimal immune protection from the second dose is achieved.","Corresponding author: Jennifer L.

During June–October 2022, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 sublineage accounted for most of the sequenced viral genomes in the United States, with further Omicron sublineage diversification through November 2022.* Bivalent mRNA vaccines contain an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain component plus an updated component of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineages. On September 1, 2022, a single bivalent booster dose was recommended for adults who had completed a primary vaccination series (with or without subsequent booster doses), with the last dose administered ≥2 months earlier (1). During September 13–November 18, the VISION Network evaluated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of a bivalent mRNA booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) compared with 1) no previous vaccination and 2) previous receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent-only mRNA vaccine doses, among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years with an emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) encounter or hospitalization for a COVID-19–like illness.† VE of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters was 56% compared with no vaccination, 31% compared with monovalent vaccination only with last dose 2–4 months earlier, and 50% compared with monovalent vaccination only with last dose ≥11 months earlier. VE of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) against COVID-19–associated hospitalizations was 57% compared with no vaccination, 38% compared with monovalent vaccination only with last dose 5–7 months earlier, and 45% compared with monovalent vaccination only with last dose ≥11 months earlier. Bivalent vaccines administered after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses were effective in preventing medically attended COVID-19 compared with no vaccination and provided additional protection compared with past monovalent vaccination only, with relative protection increasing with time since receipt of the last monovalent dose. All eligible persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, including receiving a bivalent booster dose. Persons should also consider taking additional precautions to avoid respiratory illness this winter season, such as masking in public indoor spaces, especially in areas where COVID-19 community levels are high.

Monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were developed against the spike protein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus and were found to provide cross-reactive immune protection against Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants (2). The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged in November 2021 and diversified into sublineages. These Omicron sublineages were associated with decreased protection from vaccination with monovalent vaccine (3). A single booster dose of bivalent mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) containing an updated BA.4/BA.5 component was recommended by CDC on September 1, 2022, (1) for adults who had completed a primary series with any Food and Drug Administration–approved or –authorized monovalent vaccine or who had previously received a monovalent booster dose ≥2 months earlier.§

The VISION Network¶ evaluated the effectiveness of a bivalent booster dose among immunocompetent adults during September 13–November 18, 2022, a period during which the Omicron BA.5 sublineage predominated and additional Omicron sublineages emerged. Seven health systems in nine states contributed data for this analysis. VISION methods have been described (3). Briefly, ED/UC encounters and hospitalizations associated with a COVID-19–like illness among adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result during the 14 days before through 72 hours after the encounter were included.** Patients were classified as unvaccinated (zero doses received), vaccinated with 2, 3, or 4 doses of a monovalent-only mRNA vaccine, or vaccinated with 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses plus a bivalent booster dose ≥60 days after receipt of their last monovalent dose. Encounters were excluded if 1) the patient likely had an immunocompromising condition (4); 2) only one mRNA monovalent vaccine dose was received, a second monovalent vaccine dose was received <14 days before the encounter date, or a third or fourth monovalent vaccine dose or a bivalent booster dose was received <7 days before the encounter date; 3) any dose of a non-mRNA vaccine (e.g., Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) was received; or 4) a vaccine dose was received before being recommended by CDC.†† VE was estimated using a test-negative case-control design, comparing the odds of having received versus having not received a bivalent booster dose among case-patients (those who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result) and control patients (those who received a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result).

Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day (days since January 1, 2021), geographic region, and local SARS-CoV-2 circulation (percentage of SARS-CoV-2–positive results from testing within the counties surrounding the facility on the date of the encounter). Age, calendar day, and local circulation were modeled as natural cubic splines. A single, combined model was fit for each outcome (ED/UC encounters and hospitalizations) with those who had received a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) as the referent group with the following vaccination groups: those who had received no vaccine doses (unvaccinated) (i.e., absolute VE) and those who had received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses but not a bivalent booster dose (i.e., relative VE). Varying time intervals between the last dose and the index date (2–4, 5–7, 8–10, or ≥11 months)§§ were used to calculate relative VE. Analyses were conducted using R (version 4.2.2; R Foundation). This study was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy and was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Boards at participating sites or under reliance agreement with the Institutional Review Board of Westat, Inc.¶¶

Among 78,303 ED/UC encounters with COVID-19–like illness that met inclusion criteria, 9,009 (12%) case-patients and 69,294 (89%) control patients were identified (Table 1). Overall, 24,142 (31%) were unvaccinated. Among persons who had not received a bivalent dose, 18,812 (24%), 23,042 (29%), and 8,402 (11%) had received 2, 3, and 4 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine, respectively. Among the 3,905 (5%) adults who had received a bivalent booster dose (median interval since receipt of bivalent booster dose = 25 days), 216 (6%) had received 2 monovalent doses, 1,679 (43%) had received 3 monovalent doses, and 2,010 (51%) had received 4 monovalent vaccine doses. Bivalent booster dose recipients were older (median age = 68 years) than were those who had not received a bivalent booster dose (median age = 55 years). VE of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) against ED/UC encounters for COVID-19–associated illness was 56% (95% CI = 49%–62%) compared with no vaccination, 31% (95% CI = 19%–41%) compared with receipt of last monovalent dose 2–4 months earlier, and 50% (95% CI = 43%–57%) compared with receipt of last monovalent dose ≥11 months earlier (Table 2).

Among 15,527 hospitalizations with COVID-19–like illness that met inclusion criteria, 1,453 (9%) case-patients and 14,074 (91%) control patients were identified (Table 3). Overall, 4,092 (26%) were unvaccinated. Among those who had not received a bivalent dose, 3,355 (22%), 4,766 (31%), and 2,531 (16%) had received 2, 3, and 4 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccine, respectively. Among the 783 (5%) adults who had received a bivalent booster dose (median interval since receipt of bivalent booster dose = 23 days), 49 (6%) had received 2 monovalent doses, 252 (32%) had received 3 monovalent doses, and 482 (62%) had received 4 monovalent doses. Bivalent booster dose recipients were similar in age to vaccinated adults who had not received a bivalent booster dose (median age = 76 and 73 years, respectively). VE of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) against hospitalization for COVID-19–associated illness was 57% (95% CI = 41%–69%) compared with no vaccination and 45% (95% CI = 25%–60%) compared with receipt of last monovalent doses, with last dose ≥11 months earlier (Table 2).","Discussion

Analysis of data from the multistate VISION Network found that during September–November 2022, when the BA.5 and other Omicron sublineages were the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United States, bivalent booster doses (after receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) were effective in preventing medically attended COVID-19 compared with no previous vaccination among immunocompetent adults and provided additional protection when compared with previous monovalent mRNA vaccine doses only. VE was similar against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters and hospitalizations, which might reflect changing severity of hospitalized cases over time (5). Additional studies are needed to evaluate VE against outcomes such as COVID-19–associated severe respiratory illness or death. The IVY Network, an adult inpatient VE network, recently found higher estimated VE in adults aged ≥65 years compared with estimates for those aged ≥18 years included in this analysis (6). This might reflect differences in population subgroups evaluated. Long-term durability of bivalent booster vaccination protection also could not be assessed because of the short period of observation since bivalent dose receipt. In a recent analysis from VISION, during BA.4/BA.5–predominant circulation, 3-dose monovalent VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was observed to wane from 68% at 7–119 days after vaccination to 36% at ≥120 days (5). This might explain why, among patients who had received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses only, a longer interval since the most recent dose was associated with more relative protection after receipt of the bivalent booster dose.

Bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines were developed to improve protection against circulating Omicron sublineages because of immune escape potentially associated with these subvariants and waning of monovalent vaccine-conferred protection over time (7). Real-world data suggest that bivalent boosters provide a modest degree of protection against symptomatic infection among adults compared with receipt of 2, 3, or 4 doses of monovalent vaccines only (8). Results from this study also demonstrate protection against ED/UC encounters and hospitalization during a period when BA.5 and other Omicron sublineage viruses predominated in the United States. With co-circulation of multiple respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus, vaccination against respiratory diseases for which vaccines are available is especially important to prevent illnesses resulting in health care encounters and to reduce strain on the health care system (9). Additional studies will be critical to evaluating the durability of added protection, especially with circulation of sublineages of the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron variants such as BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.

The findings in this study are subject to at least six limitations. First, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was not accounted for in this analysis. A large proportion of the population has now experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection which decreases the risk of future medically attended COVID-19 illness and might affect observed VE due to background immunity (10). Second, although models adjusted for relevant confounders, residual confounding is possible, including by behavioral differences and use of COVID-19 treatments such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). Third, sublineage-specific VE could not be estimated. Fourth, this analysis did not compare product-specific bivalent booster VE estimates. Fifth, relative VE was estimated using the interval since receipt of last monovalent dose; this study was not statistically powered to estimate whether relative VE differed by number of previous monovalent vaccine doses received. Finally, because these data are from nine states, the patients in this analysis might not be representative of the entire population of the United States. Further, this analysis included adults who received bivalent booster doses shortly after authorization who might not be fully representative of the vaccine-eligible population. For example, over one half of bivalent booster recipients had previously received 4 monovalent vaccine doses. Additional VE studies are needed as coverage of bivalent boosters increases.

In this early study of immunocompetent adults, significant protection from a booster dose of bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (after receipt of 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) compared with no vaccination was found, as well as significant relative benefits of a bivalent booster dose when compared with previous receipt of monovalent doses only. These findings support efforts to improve coverage with bivalent vaccines, although optimal timing for receipt of bivalent vaccine booster doses needs to be established. All eligible persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, including receiving a bivalent booster dose. In addition, persons should consider taking other precautions to avoid respiratory illness this winter season, including masking in public indoor spaces, especially in areas where COVID-19 community levels are high, to protect themselves and others and reduce strain on the health care system during an ongoing surge in multiple respiratory viruses.","Corresponding author: Mark W.

Since May 2022, mpox has been reported in multiple countries and regions without endemic transmission, including the United States (1). New York City (NYC) quickly became one of the major foci of the 2022 outbreak after the first case in a NYC resident was diagnosed on May 19.* Epidemiologic profiles and clinical characteristics of mpox cases in the United States during this outbreak have been described (2,3), but previous summaries were limited by incomplete data or inclusion of only a subset of cases (2,3). Most case investigation data from mpox cases reported to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) surveillance system have a high degree of completeness for gender, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, and clinical signs and symptoms. To describe the characteristics of mpox in NYC, case investigation data for NYC residents with mpox diagnosed during May 19–July 15, 2022, were analyzed. Using a standardized form, DOHMH staff members attempted to interview all NYC residents with probable (a positive non-variola Orthopoxvirus polymerase chain reaction [PCR] test result)† or confirmed (a positive MPXV–specific PCR test result) mpox reported to DOHMH through mandated laboratory reporting. For patients who declined an interview or were unreachable, information obtained from medical care providers during DOHMH consultation calls was used. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§

Among 719 NYC patients with probable or confirmed mpox, 704 (97.9%) were men; 566 (78.7%) were gay, lesbian, or queer; and 40 (5.6%) were bisexual (Table). Among 651 patients with available data on intimate or sexual exposure, 505 (77.6%) reported intimate or sexual contact with men, and among 611 patients with known contact data, 103 (16.9%) reported contact with persons with suspected mpox during the 3 weeks preceding their symptom onset. Prodromal symptoms were reported by 234 (38.1%) of 614 patients with symptom data; 277 patients (45.1%) reported proctitis or rectal symptoms (e.g., constipation, tenesmus, rectal pain, rectal bleeding, or blood in stool), 192 (69.3%) of whom did not observe perianal skin lesions, and eight (3.0%) of whom did not have any skin lesions when rectal symptoms began. Among 584 patients reporting skin lesions, 216 (37.0%) and 117 (20.0%) had genital and perianal involvement, respectively. Ophthalmic manifestations¶ were reported by 38 (6.2%) patients. The median interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was 5 days (range = 3–7 days); 101 (14.0%) patients received tecovirimat, and 35 (4.9%) were hospitalized.

Data on gender, race or ethnicity, and sexual orientation from the DOHMH surveillance system were >80% complete for patients with mpox diagnosed during the study period; these data informed public health outreach and intervention efforts.** Whereas ophthalmic involvement has been rarely reported in the current global mpox outbreak, 38 (6.2%) of 614 patients in this analysis reported ophthalmic manifestations, which can require urgent clinical management and result in longer-term sequelae (4). More than two thirds of patients with proctitis or rectal symptoms did not report perianal skin lesions. Moreover, a small number of these patients reported no skin lesions at onset of rectal symptoms. Although the current recommended method of swabbing skin lesions to diagnose mpox does not include collection of anorectal swabs, MPXV can be detected from anorectal swabs in patients with rectal symptoms†† (5). Additional studies evaluating anorectal swabs for use in mpox diagnosis might expand the range of potential specimens and enhance the possibility for early diagnosis among symptomatic persons at risk for mpox but without cutaneous lesions.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, data were missing for approximately 15% of patients, more than one half of whom were unreachable for interview; these persons might differ systematically from those who were interviewed. Second, mpox testing and treatment resources were limited during the study period, and the epidemiology has since evolved; thus, these findings might not be generalizable throughout the outbreak.

These findings can guide development of public health messaging to communities with increased likelihood of exposure to mpox; in addition to avoiding close personal contact with someone with mpox and recommendations for eligible persons to receive mpox vaccine, the clinical manifestations described in this report can guide providers managing patients with mpox. Further studies are needed to assess the potential utility of anorectal swabs in early diagnosis of mpox.",,"Corresponding author: Nang Thu Thu Kyaw, wnn5@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Kyaw NT, Kipperman N, Alroy KA, et al.

What is already known about this topic?

In 2019, India adopted the goal of measles and rubella elimination by 2023, a revision of the goal of measles elimination and control of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome by 2020.

What is added by this report?

Estimated coverage with the first dose of a measles- and rubella-containing vaccine increased from 68% to 89% in 2021. Estimated coverage with the second dose of a measles-containing vaccine increased from 27% to 82% in 2021. During 2017–2021, measles and rubella incidence declined 62% and 48%, respectively.

What are the implications for public health practice?

India has made substantial progress toward measles and rubella elimination; urgent and intensified efforts are required to achieve elimination goals by 2023. In 2019, India, along with other countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region,* adopted the goal of measles and rubella elimination by 2023,† a revision of the previous goal of measles elimination and control of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) by 2020§ (1–3). During 2017–2021, India adopted a national strategic plan for measles and rubella elimination (4), introduced rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into the routine immunization program, launched a nationwide measles-rubella supplementary immunization activity (SIA) catch-up campaign, transitioned from outbreak-based surveillance to case-based acute fever and rash surveillance, and more than doubled the number of laboratories in the measles-rubella network, from 13 to 27. Strategies included 1) achieving and maintaining high population immunity with at least 95% vaccination coverage by providing 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccines; 2) ensuring a sensitive and timely case-based measles, rubella and CRS surveillance system; 3) maintaining an accredited measles and rubella laboratory network; 4) ensuring adequate outbreak preparedness and rapid response to measles and rubella outbreaks; and 5) strengthening support and linkages to achieve these strategies, including planning and progress monitoring, advocacy, social mobilization and communication, identification and utilization of synergistic linkages of integrated program efforts, research, and development. This report describes India’s progress toward the elimination of measles and rubella during 2005–2021, with a focus on the years 2017–2021.¶ During 2005–2021, coverage with the first dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV) administered through routine immunization increased 31%, from 68% to 89%. During 2011–2021, coverage with a second MCV dose (MCV2) increased by 204%, from 27% to 82%. During 2017–2021, coverage with a first dose of RCV (RCV1) increased almost 14-fold, from 6% to 89%. More than 324 million children received a measles- and rubella-containing vaccine (MRCV) during measles-rubella SIAs completed in 34 (94%) of 36 states and union territories (states) during 2017–2019. During 2017–2021, annual measles incidence decreased 62%, from 10.4 to 4.0 cases per 1 million population, and rubella incidence decreased 48%, from 2.3 to 1.2 cases per 1 million population. India has made substantial progress toward measles and rubella elimination; however, urgent and intensified efforts are required to achieve measles and rubella elimination by 2023.

Immunization Activities

India has one of the world’s largest immunization programs, targeting a birth cohort of 27 million children annually (5). In 1985, coverage with a first dose of MCV (MCV1), administered at age 9–12 months, was introduced into the routine immunization program and MCV2, administered at age 16–24 months, was introduced in 2011. In 2017, India introduced RCV, and measles- and rubella-containing vaccine (MRCV) replaced MCV1 and MCV2 in the routine immunization schedule.** Administrative vaccination coverage (the number of vaccine doses administered divided by the estimated target population) is reported each year from all districts in India to the national immunization program, where data are aggregated and reported to WHO and UNICEF through the Joint Reporting Form. WHO and UNICEF use reported administrative coverage, country estimates, and vaccination coverage survey data to generate annual estimates of vaccination coverage through routine immunization services (6). Estimated MCV1 coverage increased 31%, from 68% in 2005 to 89% in 2021, and estimated MCV2 coverage increased 204%, from 27% in 2011 to 82% in 2021 (Table) (Figure 1). Estimated RCV1 coverage increased 1,383%, from 6% in 2017 to 89% in 2021 (Figure 2). The Fifth National Family Health Survey, conducted nationwide during 2019–2020, estimated the MCV1 coverage for children aged 12–23 months to be 88% compared with the 2005–2007 Third National Family Health Survey–estimated MCV1 coverage of 59% (7). Estimated coverage with the first MRCV dose (MRCV1) peaked at 95% in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic; coverage declined by 6 percentage points during the pandemic to 89% in 2020 and 2021. Similarly, the estimated MCV2 coverage declined from 84% in 2019 to 82% in 2021.

During 2010–2013, India conducted a phased measles catch-up SIA for children aged 9 months–10 years in 14 states, vaccinating approximately 119 million children with MCV. In December 2014, India launched Mission Indradhanush (https://www.nhp.gov.in/mission-indradhanush1_pg) as a special immunization drive to vaccinate unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children aged <2 years living in selected districts. During 2015–2021, India completed four Mission Indradhanush rounds (periodic intensification of routine immunization activity), vaccinating approximately 39 million children who had previously missed any doses of vaccines provided through routine immunization, including measles and rubella (the latter during 2018–2021). During 2017–2019, India conducted measles-rubella SIAs in a phased manner in 34 (94%) of 36 states, vaccinating approximately 324 million children with MRCV. Of the two states that did not participate in the measles-rubella SIA, West Bengal has scheduled a measles-rubella SIA for early 2023, and Delhi has yet to confirm a date for the campaign.

Surveillance Activities and Measles and Rubella Incidence

In 2005, India began using the WHO-supported acute flaccid paralysis polio surveillance platform for laboratory-supported measles and rubella outbreak-based surveillance in the state of Tamil Nadu. During the following 10 years, additional states began measles and rubella outbreak-based surveillance,†† which was implemented in all states by 2015, resulting in increased reporting of rubella cases in 2016 (Figure 2). During this period, India lowered the threshold for investigation of a suspected measles or rubella outbreak by 94%, from 20 cases per week in 2005 to five cases per 4 weeks in 2015. During 2005–2015, India’s Joint Reporting Form for measles and rubella cases included data from outbreak-based surveillance and additional sources. During 2017–2019, India transitioned from outbreak-based to case-based measles and rubella surveillance.§§ Furthermore, in 2021, after a pilot conducted in three states, India transitioned to case-based acute fever and rash surveillance¶¶ in all states (Table). To support this scale-up, the network of WHO-accredited laboratories expanded from three in 2005 to 13 in 2017; during 2017–2021, 14 additional laboratories were added to the network, for a total of 27.

Measles and rubella surveillance system indicators estimate sensitivity, timeliness, and function. During 2017–2021, the discarded nonmeasles and nonrubella cases rate,*** a measure of surveillance sensitivity, increased fivefold, from 0.30 to 1.81 per 100,000 population, and the percentage of districts with a discarded case rate ≥2 increased thirteenfold, from 3% to 42%. The timeliness of case investigations (≤48 hours of notification) improved from 83% in 2017 to 92% in 2021, and 100% of suspected cases with adequate specimens were tested in a WHO-accredited laboratory. In 2021, 94% of samples were tested ≤4 days of receipt by the laboratory; however, only 72% of laboratory results were submitted to the immunization program within 4 days of specimen receipt, potentially delaying public health action.

During 2017–2021, the incidence of measles decreased 62%, from 10.4 to 4.0 cases per million population, and the incidence of rubella declined 48%, from 2.3 to 1.2.††† During this period, among the laboratory-confirmed and epidemiologically linked measles cases, 71% of patients had received no MCV doses or had an unknown vaccination history. Similarly, 81% of persons with laboratory-confirmed and epidemiologically linked rubella had received no RCV doses or had an unknown vaccination history. In 2021, among the laboratory-confirmed and epidemiologically linked cases, 42% of measles and 58% of rubella cases were reported in children aged 9 months–4 years.

Among isolates from patients during 2017–2021, measles virus genotypes detected and reported included B3, D4, and D8; D8 accounted for 1,623 (95%) of 1,703 isolates reported. Rubella virus genotype 2B was detected and reported from 43 patients during 2017–2021. However, genotype information is available for a small proportion of measles (3%) and rubella (0.4%) cases during this period.","Discussion

During 2005–2021, India made substantial progress toward measles and rubella elimination. Through implementation of national and regional strategies, including Mission Indradhanush and two SIAs conducted in phases during several years each (2010–2013 and 2017–2019), to strengthen both routine and supplementary immunization, estimated MCV1, MCV2, and RCV1 coverage increased 31%, 204% and 1,383%, respectively. Reported measles and rubella incidence declined by 62% and 49%, respectively, during 2017–2021.

Despite this progress, India continues to face challenges in its goal to achieve measles and rubella elimination by 2023. During the COVID-19 pandemic, national routine MRCV1 coverage decreased from a peak of 95% in 2019 to 89% in 2021, and MCV2 coverage decreased from a peak of 84% (2019) to 82% (2021). In addition, the surveillance indicators demonstrated declines in sensitivity of measles and rubella surveillance from 2019 to 2020. India initiated various measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on immunization delivery and surveillance, including the dissemination of updated guidance for the continuation of immunization and surveillance, as well as state-level reviews to discuss challenges and track progress. During the second half of 2021, while continuing to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, India trained approximately 240,000 persons in fever and rash surveillance at workshops throughout the country. In 2021, 42% of districts reached the surveillance performance target of two or more discarded nonmeasles and nonrubella cases per 100,000 population, an increase of approximately 280% from 11% of districts in 2020. To address challenges with data quality and laboratory and surveillance reporting delays, India is transitioning to a new, real-time, integrated Vaccine-Preventable Disease Surveillance Information Management System.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, coverage estimates are based on administrative data and might be inaccurate because of errors in recording doses administered or in estimating the target population. Second, surveillance data might underestimate actual disease incidence because surveillance sensitivity was low: children who had measles or rubella might not have been brought in for care and not all cases in patients who sought care might have been reported. Finally, given the small number of samples sequenced, genotype data might not reflect the predominant circulating genotypes.

In September 2022, recognizing the urgent and intensified work required to achieve measles and rubella elimination by 2023, India adopted a “Roadmap to Measles and Rubella Elimination in India by 2023” (8). Given subnational variations in immunization coverage and surveillance sensitivity, the roadmap includes an action plan to intensify and monitor progress toward measles and rubella elimination with a focus on district-level implementation, tracking, and program review. With an annual birth cohort of 27 million children in India, the measles and rubella elimination program represents a remarkable opportunity to prevent death and illness from these diseases.","Corresponding author: Ratnesh Murugan, muruganr@who.int, 91-981-831-6527.","Suggested citation for this article: Murugan R, VanderEnde K, Dhawan V, et al.

What is already known about this topic?

From 2019 to 2021, overdose deaths among persons aged 14–18 years increased.

What is added by this report?

Median monthly overdose deaths among persons aged 10–19 years (adolescents) increased 109% from July–December 2019 to July–December 2021; deaths involving illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs) increased 182%. Approximately 90% of deaths involved opioids and 84% involved IMFs. Counterfeit pills were present in nearly 25% of deaths. Two thirds of decedents had one or more potential bystanders present, but most provided no overdose response. Approximately 41% of decedents had evidence of mental health conditions or treatment.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Educating adolescents about the dangers of IMFs and counterfeit pills, working with public safety to reduce availability of illicit drugs, and ensuring access to evidence-based substance use and mental health treatment could save lives. U.S. drug overdose deaths increased 30% from 2019 to 2020 and 15% in 2021, resulting in an estimated 108,000 deaths in 2021.* Among persons aged 14–18 years, overdose deaths increased 94% from 2019 to 2020 and 20% from 2020 to 2021 (1), although illicit drug use declined overall among surveyed middle and high school students during 2019–2020 (2). Widespread availability of illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs),† proliferation of counterfeit pills resembling prescription drugs but containing IMFs or other illicit drugs,§ and ease of purchasing pills through social media¶ have increased fatal overdose risk among adolescents (1,3). Using CDC’s State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS), this report describes trends and characteristics of overdose deaths during July 2019–December 2021 among persons aged 10–19 years (hereafter referred to as adolescents). From July–December 2019 to July–December 2021, median monthly overdose deaths increased 109%, and deaths involving IMFs increased 182%. Approximately 90% of overdose deaths involved opioids, and 83.9% involved IMFs; however, only 35% of decedents had documented opioid use history. Counterfeit pill evidence was present in 24.5% of overdose deaths, and 40.9% of decedents had evidence of mental health conditions or treatment. To prevent overdose deaths among adolescents, urgent efforts are needed, including preventing substance use initiation, strengthening partnerships between public health and public safety to reduce availability of illicit drugs, expanding efforts focused on resilience and connectedness of adolescents to prevent substance misuse and related harms, increasing education regarding IMFs and counterfeit pills, expanding naloxone training and access, and ensuring access to treatment for substance use and mental health disorders.

Funded jurisdictions entered data from death certificates, postmortem toxicology testing, and medical examiner or coroner reports into SUDORS for both unintentional and undetermined intent drug overdose deaths. Monthly trends in all overdose deaths and deaths involving IMFs** (4) among decedents aged 10–19 years during July 1, 2019–December 31, 2021 and percent change in the median number of monthly deaths, comparing subsequent 6-month periods, were calculated among 32 jurisdictions.†† Percentages of overdose deaths were calculated by demographic characteristics and drugs involved in 47 jurisdictions,§§ and by circumstances in 43 jurisdictions,¶¶ overall and for decedents within two age groups: 10–14 years and 15–19 years. Analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***

During July 2019–December 2021, a total of 1,808 adolescent overdose deaths occurred in 32 jurisdictions with available trend data. The number of monthly overdose deaths increased 65% overall, from 31 in July 2019 to 51 in December 2021, peaking at 87 in May 2021 (Figure 1). The number of deaths involving IMFs more than doubled, from 21 to 44 during this period, peaking at 78 in May and August 2021. Median monthly overdose deaths among adolescents increased 109%, from 32.5 during July–December 2019 to 68 during July–December 2021; during the same period, deaths involving IMFs increased 182%, from 22 to 62. Median monthly deaths increased during each 6-month period from July–December 2019 through January–June 2021 and decreased during July–December 2021 but remained approximately twice as high as during July–December 2019.

During July 2019–December 2021, among 2,231 adolescent overdose decedents in 47 jurisdictions with available data, more than two thirds (69.0%) were male, and a majority (59.9%) were non-Hispanic White persons (Table). Overall, 2,037 (91.3%) deaths involved at least one opioid; 1,871 (83.9%) involved IMFs, and 1,313 (58.9%) involved IMFs with no other opioids or stimulants. Approximately 10% of deaths involved prescription opioids, and 24.6% involved stimulants. Ninety-three (4.2%) deaths involved neither opioids nor stimulants.

Among 1,871 overdose deaths in 43 jurisdictions with available data on circumstances, 1,090 (60.4%) occurred at the decedent’s home. Potential bystanders††† were present in 1,252 (66.9%) deaths, and 1,089 (59.4%) decedents had no pulse when first responders arrived. Among deaths with one or more potential bystanders present, no documented bystander response was reported for 849 (67.8%), primarily because of spatial separation from decedents (52.9%) and lack of awareness that decedents were using drugs (22.4%). Naloxone administration was documented in 563 (30.3%) deaths. Approximately one quarter of deaths had documentation of ingestion (23.8%), smoking (23.5%), and snorting (23.0%); evidence of injection was documented in 7.8% of deaths. Evidence of counterfeit pills was documented in 24.5% of adolescent deaths. Thirty-five percent of adolescent decedents had documented opioid use history, and 14.1% had evidence of a previous overdose; 10.9% had evidence of substance use disorder treatment, and 3.3% had evidence of current treatment. Approximately 41% of decedents had documented mental health history, including mental health treatment (23.8%), diagnosed depression (19.1%), or suicidal or self-harm behaviors (14.8%) (Figure 2).","Discussion

This report describes five main findings related to overdose deaths among adolescents (persons aged 10–19 years): 1) deaths have increased substantially since the end of 2019; 2) a majority of deaths involved IMFs; 3) nearly one quarter of deaths included evidence of counterfeit pills; 4) two thirds of decedents had a potential bystander present, although most provided no overdose response; and 5) approximately 41% of decedents had a history of mental health conditions or treatment. Overdose prevention efforts promoting awareness of dangers of IMFs and aiming to treat underlying mental health and substance use disorders might help reduce adolescent overdose deaths.

From July–December 2019 to July–December 2021, median monthly overdose deaths among adolescents increased 109%. This increase occurred in the context of decreasing illicit drug use among adolescents during 2019–2020, suggesting that more potent drugs rather than increased use accounted for the increase (2). In 2021, among the general population, 73% of overdose deaths involved IMFs (5); among adolescents, a higher proportion (84%) involved IMFs, nearly all involved an opioid, and approximately 20% involved both IMFs and stimulants. Overdose prevention messaging aimed toward adolescents that highlights the dangers of IMFs and co-use of opioids and stimulants, and the expansion of naloxone access and training, are essential (6). Community-based coalitions, in collaboration with public health entities, can work with schools, physicians, youth-serving organizations, faith-based institutions, and the media to emphasize these messages, support naloxone training and access, and address stigma.§§§

Approximately 25% of adolescent deaths had evidence of counterfeit pills, which often mimic the appearance of oxycodone or alprazolam but frequently contain IMFs or other illicit drugs.¶¶¶ This percentage is likely underestimated because pills found at scenes were rarely noted as having been tested, and identifying pills as counterfeit based on appearance alone is challenging. The proliferation of counterfeit pills is particularly concerning for adolescents given marketing aimed toward this population and the availability of such pills via social media.****,†††† Whether adolescents intended to take legitimate pharmaceutical medications or were aware pills were counterfeit is unclear. Regardless, messages that highlight the potential presence of illicit drugs in pills and emphasize that pills should only be used if they are prescribed are important to include in prevention materials for adolescents. Local public health and safety officials should consider issuing warnings regarding counterfeit pills and IMFs to schools, and parents and guardians.§§§§

Potential bystanders were present during two thirds of overdose deaths among adolescents; a majority of deaths occurred at home, where bystanders were often family or friends. However, bystanders responded infrequently to the overdose because they were spatially separated (e.g., in another room) or were not aware that the decedent used drugs. Although nearly all deaths involved opioids, just 35% of decedents had documented opioid use history, suggesting recent initiation or lack of awareness by family and friends. In addition, 30% of deaths had evidence that naloxone was administered, suggesting that naloxone might not have been administered soon enough or at a sufficient dosage, or its effectiveness was affected by polydrug use. Educating family and friends to recognize warning signs of drug use, effectively respond to overdose, and monitor adolescents exhibiting risk behaviors associated with drug use might improve bystander response and prevent deaths. Educating adolescents on mitigating practices can also be beneficial, including emphasis on not initiating drug use, not using drugs while alone, using fentanyl test strips,¶¶¶¶ and having naloxone readily available for rapid use.

Approximately 41% of decedents had evidence of mental health conditions or treatment; mental health conditions are known risk factors for substance use (7). Adolescent mental health was declared a national emergency in 2021 by multiple professional organizations,***** and approximately one third of adolescents reported poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (8). Coinciding with the pandemic’s onset, overdose deaths among adolescents continued to increase during January–June 2020, possibly related to declining mental health. Known mental health conditions represent important opportunities for parents, guardians, clinicians, teachers, or other care providers to prevent initiation or recognize signs of substance use (7). Protective factors for substance use in adolescents include family engagement, parent and guardian disapproval of substance use, and school connectedness; promoting these might help prevent overdoses (7). In addition, implementing programs to prevent adverse childhood experiences that predispose adolescents to risk for substance use should be considered.††††† Among decedents, substance use disorder treatment was rare. Effective substance use disorder treatments for adolescents include psychosocial treatments, such as family-based and cognitive behavioral therapy (9) and medications for opioid use disorder (10). Given the potential for co-occurring mental health conditions and substance use disorders, integrated treatment approaches might reduce overdose risk (9,10).

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, analyses included 32 to 47 jurisdictions; results might not be generalizable to the entire United States or to other jurisdictions. Second, toxicology testing might differ over time and across jurisdictions; thus, emerging drugs, including new IMFs, might not have been identified. Finally, circumstances surrounding overdose deaths are likely underascertained because of limited investigative information.

Drug overdose deaths among adolescents increased substantially beginning in late 2019. Although deaths appear to have begun declining in late 2021, they are still alarmingly higher than in 2019. Urgent efforts to prevent overdose deaths among adolescents are needed and include 1) preventing substance use initiation and promoting protective factors; 2) strengthening partnerships between public health and public safety to reduce availability of illicit drugs; 3) expanding efforts focused on resilience and connectedness of adolescents to help prevent substance misuse and related harms; 4) educating about dangers of IMFs and counterfeit pills; 5) promoting safer drug use for those who use drugs, such as not using drugs while alone and having naloxone readily available; 6) expanding naloxone access and training family and friends in overdose recognition and response; and 7) ensuring access to effective, evidence-based substance use disorder and mental health treatment. Collaboration among public health and safety agencies, physicians, mental health and substance use treatment providers, and educators to implement these efforts could save lives.","Corresponding author: Lauren J.

What is already known about this topic?

Persons with cancer are at increased risk for dying from COVID-19.

What is added by this report?

Among persons who died with cancer, 2.0% in 2020 and 2.4% in 2021 had COVID-19 listed as the underlying cause of death, with higher percentages during COVID-19 peaks and among persons who were older, male, Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Black or African American, or living with leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma.

What are the implications for public health practice?

These results might guide COVID-19 prevention interventions and efforts focusing on reducing health disparities and addressing structural and social determinants of health among cancer survivors, which might help protect those at disproportionately increased risk for dying from COVID-19. Cancer survivors (persons who have received a diagnosis of cancer, from the time of diagnosis throughout their lifespan)* have increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness and mortality (1). This report describes characteristics of deaths reported to CDC’s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), for which cancer was listed as the underlying or a contributing cause (cancer deaths) during January 1, 2018–July 2, 2022. The underlying causes of death, including cancer and COVID-19, were examined by week, age, sex, race and ethnicity, and cancer type. Among an average of approximately 13,000 weekly cancer deaths, the percentage with cancer as the underlying cause was 90% in 2018 and 2019, 88% in 2020, and 87% in 2021. The percentage of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause differed by time (2.0% overall in 2020 and 2.4% in 2021, ranging from 0.2% to 7.2% by week), with higher percentages during peaks in the COVID-19 pandemic. The percentage of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause also differed by the characteristics examined, with higher percentages observed in 2021 among persons aged ≥65 years (2.4% among persons aged 65–74 years, 2.6% among persons aged 75–84 years, and 2.4% among persons aged ≥85 years); males (2.6%); persons categorized as non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (3.4%), Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (3.2%), or non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (2.5%); and persons with hematologic cancers, including leukemia (7.4%), lymphoma (7.3%), and myeloma (5.8%). This report found differences by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and cancer type in the percentage of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause. These results might guide multicomponent COVID-19 prevention interventions and ongoing, cross-cutting efforts to reduce health disparities and address structural and social determinants of health among cancer survivors, which might help protect those at disproportionate and increased risk for death from COVID-19.

Final mortality data for 2018–2020 and provisional mortality data for 2021–2022, reported to NVSS as of September 4, 2022, were used to assess deaths occurring among U.S. residents in the 50 states and District of Columbia during January 1, 2018–July 2, 2022.† The underlying cause of death and any contributing causes were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (2). A single underlying cause of death is listed on the death certificate as the disease or injury initiating the chain of morbid events leading directly to death. Other diseases or conditions might be listed as contributing causes of death if they increased susceptibility to or exacerbated an existing disease or contributed to death in some way but did not initiate the chain of events leading to death.§ Cancer deaths were defined as those with malignant neoplasm (ICD-10 codes C00–C97) listed as either the underlying or a contributing cause of death. The weekly numbers of cancer deaths, and their underlying causes, were tabulated.¶ The percentages (and 95% Wilson CIs) of cancer deaths with cancer or COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death were examined by year, age, sex, race and ethnicity, and cancer type.** This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††

On average, approximately 13,000 deaths each week listed cancer as an underlying or contributing cause (range = 12,221–14,845) during January 7, 2018–July 2, 2022, with peaks occurring in January 2021 (14,284) and January 2022 (14,845) (Figure 1) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/122581). Approximately 11,500 cancer deaths with cancer as the underlying cause occurred each week during this period, ranging from 10,891 in June 2020 to 12,408 in January 2018. From 2018 to 2021, the annual number of cancer deaths increased 4.7%, and the number with cancer as the underlying cause increased 1.0%. During 2020–2022, the weekly number of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause ranged from 28 to 1,055, peaking in January 2021 (953) and January 2022 (1,055). The weekly number of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as a contributing cause ranged from 10 to 463 during 2020–2022 and was highest in January 2021 (242) and January 2022 (463).

Among cancer deaths, the percentage with cancer as the underlying cause was 90% in 2018 and 2019 (weekly range = 89%–91%), 88% (83%–90%) in 2020, and 87% (83%–89%) in 2021 (Table); during the first half of 2022, this percentage ranged from 81% to 89%. Among deaths with cancer as a contributing cause, common noncancer underlying causes included diseases of the circulatory system, including heart disease and stroke; mental and behavioral disorders and diseases of the nervous system, including Alzheimer disease; endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and digestive system diseases, including diabetes and cirrhosis; diseases of the respiratory system, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, influenza, and pneumonia; and COVID-19 (Figure 2). During November 22, 2020–February 6, 2021, and January 9–February 19, 2022, the number of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as underlying cause exceeded the number for any other underlying cause, except cancer. The percentage of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause was 2.0% in 2020 (weekly range = 0.2%–6.4%) and 2.4% in 2021 (range = 0.4%–6.7%) (Table); during the first half of 2022, this percentage ranged from 1.0% to 7.2%.

The percentage of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause differed by demographic characteristics and type of malignancy. In 2021, a higher percentage of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause occurred among males (2.6%) than females (2.1%); persons aged ≥65 years (2.4% among persons aged 65–74 years, 2.6% among persons aged 75–84 years, and 2.4% among persons aged ≥85 years) than among those aged 15–64 years (ranging from 1.5% to 2.1% by age group); and AI/AN persons (3.4%), Hispanic persons (3.2%), and Black persons (2.5%) compared with a range from 1.5% to 2.3% among persons of other racial and ethnic groups. A higher percentage of hematologic cancer deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause (7.4% of leukemia, 7.3% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and 5.8% of myeloma deaths) compared with 0.6% of pancreatic cancer deaths, 2.8% of breast cancer deaths, and 3.6% of prostate cancer deaths.","Discussion

Cancer was one of the first conditions to be linked with increased risk for severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (1). This report showed that the number of cancer deaths with cancer as the underlying cause increased slightly from 2018 to 2021, but relatively less than the increase in the number of deaths from cancer as any cause of death, indicating that an excess number of persons with cancer died from COVID-19 and other diseases. The number of cancer deaths that were due to noncancer underlying conditions was highest during winter months in 2021 and 2022, which correspond to peaks in COVID-19 infection.§§ Whereas many of these cancer deaths listed COVID-19 as the underlying cause, other cancer deaths during this time might have had underlying conditions (e.g., heart disease) exacerbated by unreported COVID-19 illness or underlying conditions (e.g., drug overdose or cirrhosis) exacerbated by changes in health behaviors during the pandemic (3).

Some persons might be moderately or severely immunocompromised because of their cancer or cancer treatment, such as active treatment for solid tumors or blood cancers or high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system.¶¶ Because hematologic cancers develop in the immune system, persons living with these cancers tend to have weakened immune systems and might be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection and disease progression (4). This report found that a disproportionately high percentage of persons with leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and other hematologic cancers died from COVID-19.

Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of severe COVID-19 illness (5). Additional doses in the primary series and boosters are generally recommended for persons who are moderately or severely immunocompromised.*** Health care providers can inform their cancer patients about the recommended COVID-19 vaccination series and the timing of COVID-19 vaccination administration relative to their cancer treatment (6). Up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination for close contacts has been shown to protect cancer patients from infection (7). Other interventions, such as mask use, physical distancing, good hand hygiene, and adequate indoor ventilation, are shown to prevent infection.††† Some cancer patients might benefit from monoclonal antibodies as preexposure prophylaxis or from anti–SARS-CoV-2 therapies such as Paxlovid and molnupiravir (7).

This report found a disproportionately high percentage of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause among Hispanic, AI/AN, and Black persons compared with the percentage in other racial and ethnic groups. Similar disparities have been observed for COVID-19 mortality (8) as well as cancer mortality (9). Health inequities are driven, in part, by structural racism, discrimination, stigma, and longstanding disenfranchisement (10). CDC is collaborating with local, state, tribal, and national partners to address environmental, place-based, occupational, policy, and systemic factors that affect health outcomes.§§§ For example, national cancer programs funded by CDC are required to include activities to identify drivers of cancer health disparities and address inequities in populations disproportionately affected by the increased risk for cancer or by the lack of adequate health care options for prevention or treatment.¶¶¶ Disproportionately affected populations can be defined by sex, race, religion, ethnicity, culture, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, geographic location, socioeconomic status, insurance status, literacy level, or the intersection of several of these factors that collectively affect health outcomes.

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, 2021 and 2022 data are provisional, and numbers might change as additional information is received. Second, ethnicity, race, or both might have been inaccurately recorded on death certificates,**** which might result in under- or overestimates of death counts in some groups. Finally, information about cancer diagnosis that might be related to prognosis, such as date of diagnosis, screening status, treatment status, or barriers to cancer care, was not available in the death certificate; some cancer survivors might have been in treatment when they died, whereas others might have had a remote history of cancer.

This report found disproportionately higher percentage of cancer deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death among persons who were older; male; categorized as Hispanic, AI/AN, and Black; or living with certain cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. These results could guide multicomponent COVID-19 prevention interventions and ongoing, cross-cutting efforts to reduce health disparities and address structural and social determinants of health among cancer survivors, which might help protect those at disproportionately increased risk for dying from COVID-19.","Corresponding author: S.

What is already known about this topic?

Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses individually contribute to pediatric morbidity. The prevalence and severity of coinfection with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are less well understood.

What is added by this report?

During the 2021–22 influenza season, 6% of hospitalized pediatric influenza patients had SARS-CoV-2 coinfection; a higher percentage of patients with coinfection required invasive or noninvasive respiratory support compared with those with influenza only. Among influenza-associated pediatric deaths, 16% had SARS-CoV-2 coinfection; only one coinfected decedent received influenza antivirals, and none had been fully vaccinated against influenza.

What are the implications for public health practice?

The public should adopt prevention strategies, including influenza and COVID-19 vaccination, and consider mask use during high respiratory virus circulation. The 2022–23 influenza season shows an early rise in pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations (1). SARS-CoV-2 viruses also continue to circulate (2). The current influenza season is the first with substantial co-circulation of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 (3). Although both seasonal influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 can contribute to substantial pediatric morbidity (3–5), whether coinfection increases disease severity compared with that associated with infection with one virus alone is unknown. This report describes characteristics and prevalence of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 coinfections among patients aged <18 years who had been hospitalized or died with influenza as reported to three CDC surveillance platforms during the 2021–22 influenza season. Data from two Respiratory Virus Hospitalizations Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) platforms (October 1, 2021–April 30, 2022),§ and notifiable pediatric deaths associated¶ with influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection (October 3, 2021–October 1, 2022)** were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 coinfections occurred in 6% (32 of 575) of pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations and in 16% (seven of 44) of pediatric influenza-associated deaths. Compared with patients without coinfection, a higher proportion of those hospitalized with coinfection received invasive mechanical ventilation (4% versus 13%; p = 0.03) and bilevel positive airway pressure or continuous positive airway pressure (BiPAP/CPAP) (6% versus 16%; p = 0.05). Among seven coinfected patients who died, none had completed influenza vaccination, and only one received influenza antivirals.†† To help prevent severe outcomes, clinicians should follow recommended respiratory virus testing algorithms to guide treatment decisions and consider early antiviral treatment initiation for pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, including those with SARS-CoV-2 coinfection who are hospitalized or at increased risk for severe illness. The public and parents should adopt prevention strategies including considering wearing well-fitted, high-quality masks when respiratory virus circulation is high and staying up-to-date with recommended influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations for persons aged ≥6 months.

CDC collects data on influenza-associated hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), a population-based RESP-NET system that includes more than 250 acute care hospitals.§§ Since March 2020, CDC has also collected data on COVID-19–associated hospitalizations through another RESP-NET platform, the COVID-19–associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET). Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 testing¶¶ is driven by clinician decisions or hospital testing policies, with laboratory, clinical, and notifiable disease database sources used to identify patients.*** A FluSurv-NET patient was defined as a person who 1) was a resident of the surveillance catchment area, 2) had a hospital admission during October 1, 2021–April 30, 2022, and 3) had a positive influenza test result within 14 days before or anytime during hospitalization. Coinfected patients were those who met the FluSurv-NET definition and who also 1) had laboratory-confirmed influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections during the same hospitalization, or 2) were identified through COVID-NET and had a COVID-19–associated hospital admission occurring within 14 days before or after an influenza-associated hospitalization. A patient was considered to have received the current seasonal influenza vaccine if ≥1 dose was administered ≥14 days before the positive influenza test result.†††

Data on influenza-associated pediatric deaths that occurred during October 3, 2021–October 1, 2022, were obtained from the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System. A notifiable death is defined as a death in a person aged <18 years resulting from a clinically compatible illness confirmed to be influenza by laboratory testing§§§ without a period of complete recovery between illness onset and death. State and local health departments report investigations of these deaths to CDC using a standardized case report form, which includes data on demographic characteristics, influenza testing, bacterial and viral co-detections, clinical diagnoses and complications, medication use, and influenza vaccination. Coinfections with SARS-CoV-2 were identified using the “viral coinfection” field, with either COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 indicated in free text.

Across all data sources, patients were eligible to be included in this analysis if they were aged <18 years and had evidence of influenza virus infection. Information on COVID-19 vaccination and antiviral treatment was not included because of lack of systematic ascertainment for patients across data sources. Demographic and clinical characteristics, in-hospital interventions, and outcomes are reported by illness status (influenza and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection and influenza infection alone) as frequencies and proportions, with between-group comparisons analyzed using Pearson’s chi-square tests for hospitalizations and Fisher’s exact tests for deaths. Medians and IQRs are presented for continuous variables, with between-group comparisons analyzed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Data were analyzed using SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute). These activities were reviewed by CDC and were consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶

Hospitalizations. During October 1, 2021–April 30, 2022, FluSurv-NET identified 575 pediatric influenza-associated hospitalizations, including 32 (6%) patients who were coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and 543 (94%) who had influenza alone (hereafter, influenza) (Figure). Underlying medical conditions were reported for the majority of hospitalized patients with coinfection (56%) and with influenza (58%) (p = 0.81), whereas receipt of seasonal influenza vaccination was less prevalent among those with coinfections (17%) than among those with influenza (42%) (p = 0.02) (Table 1). A higher proportion of patients with coinfection than with influenza received invasive mechanical ventilation (13% versus 4%; p = 0.03) and BiPAP or CPAP (16% versus 6%; p = 0.05). No significant differences were found between patients with coinfection and with influenza in the prevalence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (p = 0.20). No in-hospital deaths were identified with FluSurv-NET in either group.

Deaths. Forty-four influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System during the 2021–22 influenza season, including seven (16%) decedents who had SARS-CoV-2 coinfection (Figure). Among influenza vaccine–eligible children who died and for whom data were available, zero of six with coinfections and five (16%) of 31 with influenza had been vaccinated against influenza (p = 0.57) (Table 2). The most common complications among decedents with coinfections were pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and bronchiolitis. Among decedents with influenza, the most common complications were pneumonia, seizures, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Cardiomyopathy or myocarditis occurred in five (16%) of 32 decedents with influenza and none with coinfection (p = 0.57). One or more underlying medical conditions were reported for four of five children with coinfections who died and 21 (58%) of 36 with influenza (p = 0.63). Influenza antiviral therapy was administered to one child with a coinfection who died and 17 (46%) decedents with influenza (p = 0.21).","The 2020–21 influenza season, which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, was characterized by historically low influenza circulation (6). However, an unusually late increase in influenza activity occurred in April 2022 during the 2021–22 season (7). In this analysis of 2021–22 influenza data from three CDC surveillance systems, among all pediatric patients who received testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses and who were hospitalized or died with influenza, most had underlying medical conditions and were not fully vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 coinfections were infrequent (representing 6% of hospitalizations and 16% of deaths within these populations), likely in part because of lower-than-usual influenza virus circulation. However, these data identified increased use of invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation among coinfected patients, indicating potentially more severe disease among children and adolescents with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. These findings also highlight the underuse of influenza antivirals and seasonal influenza vaccines, particularly among persons aged <18 years with influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 coinfections who died.

These findings represent a small number of cases of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, thereby limiting the ability to draw firm conclusions. The high degree of cocirculation of multiple respiratory viruses during the current season (1,2), and the higher-than-usual early-season influenza activity, underscore the importance of increasing awareness among parents and providers that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 coinfections occur in pediatric patients and that coinfection can potentially cause more severe illness. For pediatric patients with acute respiratory illness symptoms with suspected severe illness, testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory viruses is critical to facilitate early detection of coinfections and help guide clinical treatment and management (8).

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, viral testing was performed at the clinician’s discretion or according to hospital policy and might have been influenced by factors including clinical presentation, severity of illness, and previous testing. Both influenza-only and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection cases were not detected if testing for influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 was not performed for patients with acute respiratory illness. However, coinfected patients might be overrepresented in these results among patients with more severe disease (e.g., on respiratory support) if they were more likely to have been tested for both influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. Second, information on COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 antiviral treatment was not included because this information could not be systematically ascertained for patients across all data sources. Third, whereas the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System reflects data across all U.S. states and territories, FluSurv-NET and COVID-NET catchment areas include approximately 9%–10% of the U.S. population, limiting the generalizability of results. Fourth, circulation of influenza A and B viruses was lower during 2021–22 than during pre–COVID-19 seasons, thus reducing the number of patients included in the analysis and limiting the ability to examine the clinical effects of COVID-19 on the clinical course of influenza. Ongoing surveillance can help to assess the clinical progression and associated severity of pediatric influenza and SARS-CoV-2 coinfections. Fifth, because of the variability in testing practices found in passive surveillance systems such as the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System (e.g., influenza testing not being performed or being performed late in the course of the illness when influenza could not be detected), pediatric deaths were likely underreported. Finally, SARS-CoV-2–only infections were not reported because these data were not available in the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System.

To prevent and mitigate the incidence of severe respiratory virus–associated illness during periods of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 cocirculation, the public and parents should be aware of the risk for pediatric coinfection and adopt prevention strategies, including considering wearing well-fitted, high-quality masks when respiratory virus circulation is high and annual influenza vaccination and up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination (9,10). To identify coinfections with influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, clinicians should follow recommended testing algorithms for patients with acute respiratory illness symptoms in outpatient, emergency department, and hospital settings. Clinical guidance on early initiation of antiviral treatment for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 should be followed for pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infections (or both), who are hospitalized, have severe or progressive disease, or are at increased risk for complications (9,10).","Corresponding author: Katherine Adams, kadams7@cdc.gov, 404-639-0630.","Suggested citation for this article: Adams K, Tastad KJ, Huang S, et al.

What is already known about this topic?

Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only countries where wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) remains endemic.

What is added by this report?

Two WPV1 cases had been reported in 2022 as of September 30, compared with one case during the same period in 2021. No type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus was reported in 2022 compared with 43 cases in 2021. Since the political transition in August 2021, 3.5–4.5 million previously unreachable children were vaccinated; supplementary immunization activity (SIA) restrictions persist in the South Region.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Ensuring implementation of high-quality SIAs in all parts of Afghanistan, especially in the high-risk provinces of the South Region, will accelerate progress toward interrupting WPV1 transmission. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the two remaining countries with endemic wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) transmission (1). During 2019–2020, these countries reported their highest numbers of WPV1 cases since 2014 and experienced outbreaks of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) (2–4).* In Afghanistan, the number of WPV1 cases nearly doubled, from 29 in 2019 to 56 in 2020; 308 cVDPV2 cases were reported during 2020. After years of active conflict, the Afghanistan government was fully replaced by the Taliban de facto government on August 15, 2021. This report describes activities and progress toward polio eradication in Afghanistan during January 2021–September 2022 and updates previous reports (3,4). During January–December 2021, four WPV1 and 43 cVDPV2 cases were detected, representing decreases of 93% from 56 cases and 86% from 308 cases, respectively, during 2020. During January–September 2022 (reported as of October 20), two WPV1 cases and zero cVDPV2 cases were detected. Although no supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)† occurred during July–October 2021, SIAs resumed during November 2021 in all districts after the political transition, and 3.5–4.5 million previously unreachable persons have been vaccinated since. However, restrictions on how SIAs are conducted are still in place in the critical South Region provinces of Kandahar, Helmand, and Uruzgan. If efforts to vaccinate all children are enhanced and expanded, Afghanistan has an opportunity to interrupt WPV1 transmission during 2023.

Immunization Activities

The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF estimate of national 2021 immunization coverage with 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV3) among children aged 12–23 months was 71% compared with 75% in 2020. The estimated 1-dose coverage with injectable inactivated poliovirus vaccine was 67% in 2021 compared with 62% in 2020 (5). However, these national estimates obscure substantial subnational coverage gaps.

Because of the low quality of routine immunization (RI) data, caregiver recall dose history from investigations of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children who do not have laboratory evidence of poliovirus infection (nonpolio AFP [NPAFP]) is used as a proxy for RI coverage. Among the 2,567 infants and children aged 6–59 months with NPAFP in 2021, 68% had received ≥3 RI OPV doses nationwide; 17% had not received any RI dose. In 2022, as of August 31, these percentages were similar (67% and 17%, respectively). In 2021, 4% of children with NPAFP had not received any OPV through RI or SIAs (zero-dose children); the percentage of zero-dose children declined to 2% in 2022. By province, the highest percentages of zero-dose children in 2021 were reported from Zabul (28%) and Helmand (17%) provinces in the South Region, and from Nuristan (11%) in the East Region in 2022, as of August 31.

In 2015, WHO declared wild poliovirus type 2 to be eradicated.§ In 2016, Afghanistan joined OPV-using countries around the world in implementing a synchronized withdrawal of trivalent OPV (tOPV), containing Sabin-strain types 1, 2, and 3, and replacement with bivalent OPV (bOPV), containing Sabin-strain types 1 and 3, and ≥1 dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine as part of containment efforts for all type 2 polioviruses (6). However, in 2020 when Afghanistan began to report both cVDPV2 and WPV1 polio cases, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative authorized the use of tOPV for outbreak response. During January–December 2021, five SIAs were conducted, including two after the political transition; all were national immunization days (NIDs). During January–September 2022, nine SIAs targeting children aged <5 years were conducted: six NIDs, one subnational immunization day, and two large-scale SIAs conducted in response to a polio case (case-response SIAs). The NIDs conducted in January, March, November, and December 2021 used tOPV; the remaining SIAs in 2021 and 2022 used bOPV.

In November 2021, during the first SIA after the political transition, only 53% of the 10 million children targeted by SIAs lived in areas without any restriction on how SIAs were conducted. This percentage gradually increased and reached 76% by the September 2022 NID. The reported NID OPV coverage in areas where SIAs were conducted without restrictions increased from 72% in June 2021 to approximately 100% in March, May, and June 2022, although this figure likely overestimates true coverage because of poor target setting and data management. Reported coverage was <50% in districts with restrictions on SIA implementation. In 2022, to date, the program has reached 3.5–4.5 million children previously unreachable because the insurgency prevented access before the government transition.

Lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS)¶ surveys are conducted to assess SIA quality. Previously limited in implementation, these surveys were expanded nationwide in 2022 to include all districts. During the first five 2022 NIDs, 1,319 lots were assessed, a 65% increase over the 797 assessed during 2021, and the quality of implementing LQAS surveys improved. More lots were reported as failed at the 90% SIA coverage threshold in 2022 (37%) than in 2021 (18%); however, the primary reason was that approximately all lots in districts where SIA implementation methods were restricted failed LQAS assessments.

Poliovirus Surveillance

AFP surveillance. The Afghanistan AFP surveillance network comprises 1,947 active surveillance sites (visited by surveillance officers), 3,222 zero-reporting sites with passive monthly reporting, and 46,000 community-based reporting volunteers. Detection of two or more NPAFP cases per 100,000 persons aged <15 years** along with collection of adequate stool specimens†† from ≥80% of AFP cases indicates that surveillance is sufficiently sensitive to detect a case of paralytic polio. During 2021, the national NPAFP rate was 19 per 100,000 persons aged <15 years (regional range = 12–26); during January–August 2022, the annualized NPAFP rate was 25 (regional range = 17–40). The percentage of AFP cases with adequate specimens was 94% in 2021 and 95% to date in 2022 (regional range = 90%–98% in 2021 and 92%–98% in 2022) (Table).

Environmental surveillance. Poliovirus surveillance in Afghanistan is supplemented by environmental surveillance (ES), the systematic sampling and virologic testing of sewage at 30 sites in 13 provinces. In 2021, only one WPV1 sample was detected among ES samples from the Helmand province in the South Region. As of October 20, 2022, WPV1 was detected during the reporting period in three sites: one in Nangarhar and two in Kunar provinces in the East Region, with the latest from a site in Kunar province in September 2022. During 2021, cVDPV2 was isolated from 40 ES specimens from Helmand, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunduz, and Nangarhar provinces; the latest isolation was from an ES sample collected in June 2021 in Kandahar province.

Epidemiology of Polio Cases and Genomic Sequence Analysis of Poliovirus Isolates

Four WPV1 cases were detected in 2021, one from Ghazni province in the Southeast Region and three from Kunduz province in the Northeast Region. During January–September 2022 (as of October 20, 2022), only two WPV1 cases were reported in two regions: one each from Paktika (Southeast Region) and Kunar provinces (East Region) (Table) (Figure 1) (Figure 2). All six patients in 2021 and 2022 were aged 10–25 months; three had never received OPV through RI services but had received 1 SIA dose, one had never received any OPV, one reportedly received 2 RI doses and 1 SIA dose, and one reportedly received 4 RI doses and 7 SIA doses.

Genomic sequence analysis of the region encoding the viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) of poliovirus isolates provided evidence of cross-border transmission between Afghanistan and Pakistan during 2019–2022, with sustained local transmission in both countries. During January 2021–September 2022, four of six WPV1 isolates from AFP patients and one of four WPV1 ES isolates from Afghanistan had their closest genetic links to WPV1 isolates from Pakistan. The poliovirus isolated from the first case during 2022, reported from Paktika province (Southeast Region), was genetically linked to previous circulation in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province. The poliovirus from the second 2022 case, reported from Kunar province (East Region), was genetically linked with transmission in the Northeast Region of Afghanistan. During January 2021–September 2022, only two WPV1 genetic clusters (groups of viruses sharing ≥95% VP1 sequence identity) were detected among AFP cases and environmental samples. Of the five WPV1 viruses detected in 2021, two (40%) were orphan viruses,§§ indicating possible gaps in surveillance; no orphan viruses have been detected in 2022 to date.

Among 43 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2021, 29 (67%) were in the PAK-GB-1 emergence group, first detected in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, and 14 were in the AFG-NGR-1 emergence group, first detected in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province (3). Paralysis onset in the patient with the most recently detected cVDPV2 case was in July 2021.","Discussion

After confirmation of large numbers of both WPV1 and cVDPV2 polio cases during 2019–2020 in Afghanistan and Pakistan, both countries jointly reported five WPV1 and 51 cVDPV2 cases in 2021 (1). Given that the latest cVDPV2 detection was in Pakistan in August 2021, transmission of cVDPV2 in both countries is likely interrupted. Resurgence of WPV1 cases occurred in 2022 in the south of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, an area that directly borders Afghanistan, with substantial social ties and population movement. As of October 20, 2022, Afghanistan has reported two WPV1 cases, one each in the East and Southeast regions. After the political transition, the de facto government’s public health authorities implemented an aggressive SIA schedule during November 2021–September 2022, which resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of unreached children. However, as of September 2022, >85% of children in the South Region where polio is endemic live in areas where restrictions on SIA implementation methods continue.

The findings in this report are subject to at least one limitation. The quality of data on SIA implementation is limited by the low accuracy of reported coverage data. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is supporting the national program to establish a comprehensive data management system and providing ongoing staff member training.

Current polio eradication efforts in Afghanistan are challenged by a complex humanitarian emergency resulting from the combined impacts of a rapid government transition and a depressed economy, droughts, floods, food insecurity, displacement, and severe gaps in delivery of health services (7). In June 2022, a 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck Khost province in the Southeast Region, killing more than 1,000 persons and displacing entire communities (8). With progress broadening SIA access since the political transition, the opportunity to end WPV1 transmission in Afghanistan before the end of 2023 appears to be attainable. Ending transmission, however, depends on continued and expanded SIAs throughout the country, including in the high-risk provinces of the South Region.","Corresponding author: Abdinoor Mohamed, wyr5@cdc.gov, 678-237-3701.","Suggested citation for this article: Mohamed A, Akbar IE, Chaudhury S, et al.

What is already known about this topic?

Real-world data on the magnitude and durability of protection by JYNNEOS vaccine against monkeypox (mpox) remain limited.

What is added by this report?

Among JYNNEOS vaccine-eligible men aged 18–49 years in 43 U.S. jurisdictions, mpox incidence among unvaccinated persons was 9.6 times as high as that among persons who had received 2 vaccine doses and 7.4 times as high as that among persons who had received only the first dose. Preliminary evidence indicates no difference in protection between subcutaneous and intradermal administration routes.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Although further study is needed to determine the magnitude and durability of protection, evidence indicates that JYNNEOS vaccination provides protection against mpox. Vaccine-eligible persons should complete the 2-dose vaccination series. As of October 28, 2022, a total of 28,244* monkeypox (mpox) cases have been reported in the United States during an outbreak that has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (1). JYNNEOS vaccine (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic), administered subcutaneously as a 2-dose (0.5 mL per dose) series (with doses administered 4 weeks apart), was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 to prevent smallpox and mpox disease (2); an FDA Emergency Use Authorization issued on August 9, 2022, authorized intradermal administration of 0.1 mL per dose, increasing the number of persons who could be vaccinated with the available vaccine supply† (3). A previous comparison of mpox incidence during July 31–September 3, 2022, among unvaccinated, but vaccine-eligible men aged 18–49 years and those who had received ≥1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose in 32 U.S. jurisdictions, found that incidence among unvaccinated persons was 14 times that among vaccinated persons (95% CI = 5.0–41.0) (4). During September 4–October 1, 2022, a total of 205,504 persons received JYNNEOS vaccine dose 2 in the United States.§ To further examine mpox incidence among persons who were unvaccinated and those who had received either 1 or 2 JYNNEOS doses, investigators analyzed data on 9,544 reported mpox cases among men¶ aged 18–49 years during July 31–October 1, 2022, from 43 U.S. jurisdictions,** by vaccination status. During this study period, mpox incidence (cases per 100,000 population at risk) among unvaccinated persons was 7.4 (95% CI = 6.0–9.1) times that among persons who received only 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine ≥14 days earlier and 9.6 (95% CI = 6.9–13.2) times that among persons who received dose 2 ≥14 days earlier. The observed distribution of subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration of dose 1 among vaccinated persons with mpox was not different from the expected distribution. This report provides additional data suggesting JYNNEOS vaccine provides protection against mpox, irrespective of whether the vaccine is administered intradermally or subcutaneously. The degree and durability of such protection remains unclear. Persons eligible for mpox vaccination should receive the complete 2-dose series to optimize strength of protection†† (5).

Aggregate weekly numbers of confirmed and probable mpox cases§§ among men aged 18–49 years with illness onset (i.e., earliest date available¶¶) during July 31–October 1, 2022, were analyzed across 43 public health jurisdictions.*** These jurisdictions routinely ascertain patient vaccination status (receipt of ≥1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine) and route of vaccine administration through interviews and immunization registries and submit deidentified vaccine administration data to CDC. Persons with mpox were categorized as 1) unvaccinated†††; 2) vaccinated, with illness onset ≥14 days after administration of dose 1 and before or <14 days after receipt of dose 2; or 3) vaccinated with illness onset ≥14 days after dose 2. Persons with illness onset <14 days after receipt of dose 1, potentially vaccinated persons (possibly vaccinated but without dose number or documented date of vaccination), and persons vaccinated before 2022 were excluded.

One- and 2-dose vaccination coverage was estimated as the total number of persons vaccinated as of 2 weeks before the end date of a week divided by the estimated vaccine-eligible population aged 18–49 years, including persons in each jurisdiction who might benefit from vaccination in the context of the outbreak (estimated as the number of men who are either MSM living with HIV acquired through male-to-male sexual contact, injection drug use, or both, or who are eligible for HIV preexposure prophylaxis [HIV-PrEP])§§§ (6). The number of eligible unvaccinated persons was obtained by subtracting the number of vaccinated persons from jurisdiction-specific estimates of the vaccine-eligible population. Weekly incidence¶¶¶ by vaccination status was estimated as the number of cases divided by the number of persons either eligible but unvaccinated as of that week or vaccinated as of 2 weeks earlier.**** Weekly incidence among persons receiving dose 2 was estimated for September 4–October 1, 2022, when population coverage with 2 vaccine doses among the total eligible population was nearly 5%. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) during the study period was calculated using negative binomial regression, controlling for week in the model using an indicator variable, which is a modified approach to that used in previous analyses (4).

A supplementary analysis was conducted estimating the effect of dose 1 and dose 2. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis that accounted for follow-up time among unvaccinated persons compared with that among persons known to have received either 1 or both vaccine doses was used.

The observed distribution of subcutaneous and intradermal routes of administration of dose 1 among vaccinated persons with mpox was compared with the expected distribution†††† among all vaccinated persons, based on vaccine administration records in 14 jurisdictions with complete route of administration data for ≥80% of reported vaccinated persons with mpox.

SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.0.3; R Foundation) were used to conduct all analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§§

During July 31–October 1, 2022, in 43 jurisdictions reporting 11,581 mpox cases (range across jurisdictions = 2–3,424 cases), a total of 9,544 (82.4%) were reported among men aged 18–49 years (Table 1). Among these cases, 8,320 (87.2%) occurred in unvaccinated persons and 1,224 (12.8%) in vaccinated persons, including 218 (17.8%) in persons without a known vaccination date. Among cases in vaccinated persons whose vaccination date was known, 614 (61%) were in persons whose illness onset occurred ≤13 days after receipt of dose 1 and 392 (39%) in persons with illness onset ≥14 days after receipt of dose 1; among this group, 48 cases (12.2%) (0.5% of all cases) were among persons with illness onset ≥14 days after receipt of dose 2. Population coverage with ≥1 vaccine dose received ≥14 days before the end of each week increased from 5.7% (July 31) to 45.5% (September 25); 2-dose coverage increased from 0.1% to 17%.

Mpox incidence estimates were higher among unvaccinated persons than among persons known to have received only 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine ≥14 days earlier (IRR = 7.4; 95% CI = 6.0–9.1) and among those who received dose 2 ≥14 days earlier (IRR = 9.6; 95% CI = 6.9–13.2) (Figure). A supplementary analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model to account for follow-up time also indicated that incidence was higher among unvaccinated persons than among persons known to have only received dose 1 (hazard ratio = 4.3; 95% CI = 3.9–4.8) and those who received 2 doses (hazard ratio = 7.6; 95% CI = 5.7–10.2), although the strength of the effect was somewhat attenuated compared with the primary analysis (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/122452).

Among persons with illness onset ≥14 days after vaccine dose 1, 263 (87.1%) and 39 (12.9%) had received subcutaneous and intradermal administration, respectively. The proportion of vaccinated persons with mpox known to have received dose 1 subcutaneously or intradermally was not statistically different from that of the overall vaccinated population (83% and 17%, respectively) (p = 0.28) (Table 2).","Discussion

In this evaluation of mpox among men aged 18–49 years, incidences were lower among those who were vaccinated than among unvaccinated, vaccine-eligible persons. A proportional hazards model that accounted for time-varying risk supported the finding of a larger risk reduction among persons who had received 2 vaccine doses than among those who had received only 1 dose. Compared with a previous report (4), this analysis expands knowledge about mpox incidence by vaccination status by including more jurisdictions during a longer observation period, resulting in the addition of the equivalent of >1 million person-weeks of follow-up. Further, increased completeness of vaccination administration date (from 43% to 82% completeness) and a better-fitting statistical model yielded more precise effect estimates. These findings are consistent with those of the previous analysis as well as recent studies reporting some protection (7) and modest induction of antibody levels (8,9) after the first JYNNEOS vaccine dose.

The analysis also suggested no difference in vaccine performance between subcutaneous and intradermal administration. This supports previous clinical trial data that indicated similar immune responses to JYNNEOS vaccination over time after intradermal or subcutaneous administration (10).

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, linkage of mpox case surveillance and vaccination administration data might have resulted in misclassifications that could influence estimates. This approach assumed that persons with unknown vaccination status were unvaccinated and excluded those with unknown date of vaccination, because timing between vaccination and illness onset could not be established, potentially underestimating incidence among vaccinated persons. Second, this analysis was unable to control for possible differences in testing or behaviors that affect the risk for Monkeypox virus exposure (e.g., reducing number of sexual partners), or possible differences in risk of infection because of patient characteristics (e.g., age, underlying medical conditions, and HIV-associated immune suppression); consequently, causal attribution of these results to vaccination cannot be definitively inferred from these data. Third, temporality of exposures that result in infection is not known, nor was it possible to determine whether vaccination was administered as postexposure or preexposure prophylaxis. Fourth, confirmation that all identified persons with mpox were members of the population eligible for vaccination was not possible. Finally, considering persons vaccinated as of 2 weeks before the end date of a surveillance week could overestimate the number of persons vaccinated each week and, thus, underestimate the weekly incidence among vaccinated persons.

Monitoring mpox incidence by vaccination status using currently available surveillance data provides an indication of the real-world impact of JYNNEOS vaccine on prevention of mpox to guide rapid public health decision-making, subject to the limitations noted. Although the findings suggest a protective effect of JYNNEOS vaccination, additional epidemiologic studies that better account for potential biases will provide additional data on the magnitude and duration of protection by JYNNEOS against mpox. These findings also suggest that JYNNEOS vaccination provides protection against mpox infection, irrespective of route of administration. Persons who are eligible for mpox vaccination should receive the complete recommended 2-dose series to optimize their protection against mpox (5).","Corresponding author: Amanda B.

What is already known about this topic?

JYNNEOS vaccine has been used in a real-world setting for the first time during the 2022 monkeypox (mpox) outbreak, including intradermal administration under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization.

What is added by this report?

During May 22–October 21, 2022, nearly 1 million JYNNEOS doses were administered in the United States. The vaccine safety profile was consistent with prelicensure studies. The most common adverse health events reported were nonserious and included injection site reactions. Serious adverse events were rare among adults, and no serious adverse events have been identified among persons aged <18 years.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Surveillance supports JYNNEOS vaccine safety. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor the safety of JYNNEOS. JYNNEOS (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic) is recommended in the United States for persons exposed to or at high risk for exposure to Monkeypox virus during the 2022 monkeypox (mpox) outbreak (1). JYNNEOS is a live, nonreplicating viral vaccine licensed for the prevention of smallpox and mpox in adults aged ≥18 years, administered as a 0.5-mL 2-dose series given 28 days apart by subcutaneous injection (2). On August 9, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for administration of 0.1 mL doses by intradermal injection for adults aged ≥18 years as a strategy to increase vaccine supply, and administration of 0.5 mL doses subcutaneously for persons aged <18 years (3). During May 22–October 21, 2022, a total of 987,294 JYNNEOS vaccine doses were administered in the United States. CDC has monitored JYNNEOS vaccine safety using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) for vaccine recipients of all ages, and through single-patient emergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) procedures for persons aged <18 years vaccinated before August 9, 2022. The most common adverse health events reported to VAERS for adults were nonserious and included injection site reactions, which was consistent with the prelicensure studies. Adverse health events were reported at similar rates for doses received by intradermal and subcutaneous administration. Serious adverse events were rare in adults, and no serious adverse events have been identified among persons aged <18 years. Overall, postlicensure and postauthorization surveillance to date support JYNNEOS vaccine safety.

VAERS is a national passive surveillance system for adverse events after vaccination (4). VAERS accepts reports from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public. The JYNNEOS EUA requires reporting the following events to VAERS: vaccine administration errors (whether or not associated with an adverse event), serious adverse events (irrespective of attribution to vaccination), and cases of cardiac, thromboembolic, and neurovascular events.* Reported signs and symptoms are coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.† Adverse events that are serious or of special interest are followed up by obtaining medical records, information from health care providers, and, in cases of death, death certificates and autopsy reports. Adverse events of special interest include anaphylaxis (an adverse event that can occur after any vaccine), and myocarditis, which is associated with older smallpox vaccines (5,6). Reports received and processed by October 21, 2022, were included.§ Adverse event reporting rates were calculated by dividing the number of reports by the number of vaccine doses administered during May 22–October 14 (to allow a minimum of 7 days for VAERS reporting) and reported to CDC by October 24, 2022 (7).

VSD is a collaboration between CDC and several integrated health care systems that uses electronic health record data to perform active vaccine safety surveillance (8). VSD identified medical visits with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes for myocarditis or pericarditis¶ that occurred within 30 days after either dose of JYNNEOS and verified the diagnosis using medical record review. Eight VSD health care systems contributed data to this assessment. For VAERS and VSD, rates and bivariate rate ratios (RRs) with associated 95% CIs were estimated and compared using Fisher’s exact test; analyses were conducted using OpenEpi software (version 3.01; OpenEpi).

CDC facilitated JYNNEOS EIND authorizations from FDA for 65 persons aged <18 years. CDC solicited information from vaccine providers about adverse events occurring during the 28 days after each dose. All activities described were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**

During the surveillance period (May 22–October 21, 2022), 987,294 JYNNEOS vaccine doses were administered in the United States, including 652,641 (66%) first doses and 334,568 (34%) second doses. Approximately one half (51%) of doses were administered intradermally, one third (34%) subcutaneously, and the remaining 15% by unknown or other routes. Overall, 90% of vaccinated persons were male. JYNNEOS vaccine was administered to 1,003 persons aged <18 years.

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System

VAERS received 1,350 reports for JYNNEOS. Most reports were for males (84%), after dose 1 (63%), and for vaccine doses administered either intradermally (54%) or subcutaneously (25%) (Table 1). Approximately one half of reports (638; 47%) documented a vaccine administration error, 624 (98%) of which did not mention an adverse health event. The administration error reporting rate was higher for intradermal (818 per million doses administered) than for subcutaneous administration (314) (RR = 2.61; 95% CI = 2.10–3.26). The most common perceived vaccination error reported for intradermal administration was absence of a wheal without vaccine leakage on the first injection attempt (220 [54%] of 410 error reports). Among all VAERS reports, 685 (51%) documented an adverse health event. The reporting rates of adverse health events were similar for intradermal and subcutaneous administration (648 and 627 reports per million doses administered, respectively) (RR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.87–1.24). The most common types of adverse health events reported differed by route of administration (Table 2).

Fourteen reports (1%) were classified as serious. Two deaths in males aged 37 and 58 years were reported, both within 2 days of vaccination. In one case, drowning was the cause of death. The death certificate is pending for the other case. Nine reports were classified as serious because of hospitalization for the following events: myocarditis (two), pericarditis (two), appendicitis (one), aseptic meningitis (one), atrial fibrillation (one), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (one), and methemoglobinemia (one). Three vaccinated persons reported the following events as representing disability or permanent damage in their own assessment: injection site discoloration (one), injection site pain (one), and injection site scar (one).

The myocarditis reporting rate was 1.53 cases per million doses within 30 days after receipt of dose 1 and 2.99 after dose 2. Three reports of anaphylaxis within 24 hours of vaccination were received (overall reporting rate = 3.04; 95% CI = 0.63–8.88 cases per million doses administered) (Table 3).

VAERS received 13 reports for persons aged <18 years, one of which included an adverse health event (syncope). The other reports for persons in this age group were related to vaccine administration errors, most commonly inadvertent intradermal rather than subcutaneous administration (six), which is the authorized route of administration for persons aged <18 years.

Top
Vaccine Safety Datalink

As of October 21, 2022, a total of 43,253 JYNNEOS doses had been administered to persons in the VSD population, representing approximately 4.3% of all doses administered nationally. Among 25,659 males and 1,953 females who received dose 1, 58% and 37%, respectively, also received dose 2. One case of myocarditis was identified after each dose in males. The incidence among males after dose 1 was 39 per million doses (95% CI = 0.1–217.1) and after dose 2 was 67 (95% CI = 1.7–374.4).

Top
Emergency Investigational New Drug Authorizations

Among the 65 persons aged <18 years for whom CDC obtained EIND authorization for vaccination, 55 were confirmed to have received ≥1 vaccine dose. CDC also received vaccine follow-up information for seven additional persons aged <18 years who were vaccinated under the EUA. Overall, vaccine recipients ranged in age from 4 months to 17 years, and 58% were male. Information about whether adverse events occurred was received for 57 of the 62 persons aged <18 years vaccinated. Adverse events were reported for 10 (18%) of 57 after the first dose and five (21%) of 24 after the second dose. Most were injection site reactions, including pain, erythema, swelling, and induration. Systemic adverse events included fever, fatigue, and headache. No serious adverse events were reported.","Monitoring of JYNNEOS vaccine safety in the United States during the 2022 mpox outbreak has not identified any new or unexpected safety concerns among adults or persons aged <18 years. The VAERS reporting rate of anaphylaxis after JYNNEOS is similar to rates previously published after receipt of other vaccines (9). JYNNEOS safety in persons aged <18 years had not been assessed before this outbreak. Pediatric vaccine safety information collected to date has not identified any concerning adverse events.

Not all adverse events that occur after vaccination are caused by the vaccine. Currently, no evidence indicates that either of the two deaths reported to VAERS after JYNNEOS administration were caused by the vaccine. These two deaths within 2 days of vaccination are less than the number expected to occur by chance alone. For example, during 2019, an average of six deaths occurred daily per 1 million men aged 35–39 years (10).

Myocarditis is associated with live, replicating smallpox vaccines, such as ACAM2000, with incidence point estimates for symptomatic cases ranging from 78 to 5,230 cases per million persons within 30 days after vaccination (5,6). The background myocarditis rate has been estimated to be 21.6 cases per million in a 30-day period (5). The VAERS myocarditis reporting rate (1.53 and 2.99 per million first and second vaccine doses administered, respectively) is at least seven times lower than the background rate. VSD myocarditis incidence estimates have wide CIs that encompass both the background rate and the lower incidence estimates for the replicating smallpox vaccines. Current data do not suggest an increased risk for myocarditis after receipt of JYNNEOS, but the possibility of a small risk cannot be excluded.

Vaccine administration errors have been reported more often following intradermal than subcutaneous administration of JYNNEOS vaccine. The most common issue reported has been a wheal not forming with the initial injection. CDC’s interim clinical considerations for use of JYNNEOS state that absence of a wheal without vaccine leakage may be counted as valid administration (1).

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, VAERS is a passive reporting system and is subject to underreporting and reporting biases; for example, the two myocarditis cases identified by VSD were not reported to VAERS. Common, nonserious adverse events, such as injection site reactions, are less likely to be reported compared with serious adverse events. Second, comparison of VAERS reporting rates to published background rates might not signal a potential risk if the published rate is higher than the vaccinated population’s true background rate. Finally, VSD might not receive JYNNEOS vaccine administration data for all out-of-network doses; vaccination history might be recorded more often for patients with a medical visit for an adverse event, which could lead to overestimating adverse event incidence.

JYNNEOS postlicensure and postauthorization vaccine safety surveillance findings to date are consistent with those observed in the clinical trials, and support JYNNEOS vaccine safety with no new or unexpected safety concerns identified. Serious adverse events were rare among adults, and none have been identified among persons aged <18 years. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor the safety of JYNNEOS. Health care providers should continue to report adverse events after JYNNEOS to VAERS.††","Corresponding author: Jonathan Duffy, jduffy@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Duffy J, Marquez P, Moro P, et al.

In 2020, 316,023 (10.3%) deaths among ever-employed persons were associated with COPD. The COPD proportionate mortality ratios were elevated for several industries and occupations, and highest among workers in the mining industry and in food preparation and serving–related occupations.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Elevated COPD mortality among workers in certain industries and occupations underscores the importance of targeted interventions, including reduction or elimination of COPD-related risk factors and workplace smoke-free policies, to prevent COPD from developing and to intervene before illness becomes symptomatic or severe. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive lung disease, is characterized by long-term respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation (1). COPD accounts for most of the deaths from chronic lower respiratory diseases, the sixth leading cause of death in the United States in 2020.* Workplace exposures and tobacco smoking are risk factors for COPD; however, one in four workers with COPD have never smoked (2–4). To describe COPD mortality among U.S. residents aged ≥15 years categorized as ever-employed (i.e., with information on their usual industry and occupation), CDC analyzed the most recent 2020 multiple cause-of-death data† from 46 states and New York City.§ Among 3,077,127 decedents, 316,023 (10.3%) had COPD¶ listed on the death certificate. The highest age-adjusted** COPD death rates per 100,000 ever-employed persons were for females (101.3), White persons (116.9), and non-Hispanic or Latino (non-Hispanic) persons (115.8). The highest proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs)†† were for workers employed in the mining industry (1.3) and in food preparation and serving related occupations (1.3). Elevated COPD mortality among workers in certain industries and occupations underscores the importance of targeted interventions (e.g., reduction or elimination of COPD-associated risk factors, engineering controls, and workplace smoke-free policies) to prevent COPD from developing and to intervene before illness becomes symptomatic or severe.

The analysis included 3,077,127§§ U.S. residents aged ≥15 years from 47 jurisdictions (46 states and New York City) who died during 2020 and whose record in National Vital Statistics System public use multiple-cause-of-death data included information on their usual¶¶ industry and occupation. COPD was identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes J40–J44 listed as the underlying or contributing cause of death. The 23 two-digit industries and 26 occupations were grouped according to the 2012 North American Industry Classification System and the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification, respectively.***

Death rates (per 100,000 ever-employed persons) were based on postcensal population estimates as of July 1, 2020. Death rates were age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. population. PMRs adjusted for age, sex, and race were calculated. A PMR with the lower 95% CI >1.0 indicated a significantly higher proportion of deaths associated with COPD in a specified industry or occupation than expected. CIs were calculated assuming Poisson distribution of data. Analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute).

Among the 3,077,127 decedents, 316,023 (10.3%; age-adjusted death rate = 102.5 deaths per 100,000 ever-employed persons) had COPD listed on their death certificates as the underlying or contributing cause of death. The highest age-specific COPD death rate (855.8 deaths per 100,000 ever-employed persons) was for persons aged ≥75 years (Table 1). The highest age-adjusted death rates were for females (101.3), White persons (116.9), and non-Hispanic persons (115.8) (Table 1).

PMRs were significantly elevated among ever-employed persons in 10 of the 23 industries and 11 of the 26 occupations (Table 2) (Table 3). The three industries with the highest PMRs were mining (1.33), accommodation and food services (1.28), and construction (1.23). The three occupations with the highest PMRs were food preparation and serving related (1.30), healthcare support (1.29), and construction and extraction (1.29).","Discussion

In 2020, 10% of deaths among ever-employed persons aged ≥15 years in 47 jurisdictions were associated with COPD. Elevated age-adjusted COPD death rates among White and non-Hispanic persons††† are consistent with previous findings of increased COPD morbidity and mortality among these groups (3,5). During 2012–2018, an estimated 5.8 million (annual average) currently employed U.S. workers had COPD (3). An estimated 40% of adults with COPD have never smoked, and an estimated 24% of all COPD cases among never-smokers were attributed to workplace exposures (2–4), including dust, fumes, gases, vapors, and secondhand smoke (2). To reduce the prevalence of COPD among workers, the COPD National Action Plan§§§ emphasizes that occupational risk factors and interventions should be included in messaging and communication campaigns. In addition, COPD should be incorporated into prevention programs that address occupational risk factors.¶¶¶ Higher proportions of COPD deaths were observed for ever-employed persons whose usual industry was mining, accommodation and food services, construction, or transportation and material moving, and among workers whose usual occupation was healthcare support, food preparation and serving related, construction and extraction, or transportation and material moving. National survey data indicates that workers in these industries and occupations have elevated prevalence of COPD, higher tobacco use, and are frequently exposed to secondhand smoke, vapors, gas, dust, and fumes in the workplace (2,3,6–8). For example, approximately one third of the workers in mining, construction, accommodation and food services, and transportation and warehousing industries, and healthcare support, construction and extraction, food preparation and serving related occupations are combustible tobacco users and are often exposed to secondhand smoke, diesel exhaust, and byproducts of machinery combustion, as well as dusts (e.g., wood and silica dusts), vapors, and fumes (6–8). In addition, a previous study among nurses and healthcare support workers found that exposure to cleaners and disinfectants (i.e., glutaraldehyde, bleach, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, and ammonium compounds) was associated with increased (25%–38%) risk for COPD (9).

Although the exact reason for the differences in high COPD death rates among certain groups is unknown, differences could be partly explained by preventable workplace exposures including secondhand smoke, vapors, dusts, and fumes (2,6,8). Identification of hazards in the workplace could assist with early identification and implementation of public health programs (e.g., workplace smoke-free policies and cessation programs, elimination or substitution of exposures, removing workers from exposures, and engineering controls such as ventilation or enclosure of exposure-generating processes) that support comprehensive approaches to prevention through control of workplace hazards and promotion of healthy behaviors, early interventions, and better access to health care services (8).

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, COPD-related deaths were not validated using medical records. Second, no information on workplace exposures is available on death certificates. Therefore, whether workplace exposures could have led directly to the COPD death is unknown. Third, if COPD was caused by workplace exposures, the industry and occupation information reported on the death certificate might not be the industry and occupation in which workplace exposures occurred. Fourth, 38,264 decedents (1.2% of total deaths) for whom employment history was not available on the death certificate were excluded from the current study. Fifth, information on smoking status of decedents was not available; smoking is known to cause or worsen COPD. Finally, results are limited to 47 jurisdictions and might not be representative of nonparticipating jurisdictions.

Findings from this report might help physicians identify workers who should be evaluated for COPD in the industries and occupations with a higher proportion of COPD deaths. The elevated COPD mortality among ever-employed persons in certain industries and occupations underscores the importance of targeted interventions to prevent COPD from developing and intervening before it becomes symptomatic or severe. Continued surveillance, including collection of detailed industry and occupational history and etiologic research to further characterize occupational risk factors for COPD, is essential to guide interventions and policies to improve workers’ health.","Corresponding author: Girija Syamlal, gos2@cdc.gov, 304-285-5827.","Suggested citation for this article: Syamlal G, Kurth LM, Dodd KE, Blackley DJ, Hall NB, Mazurek JM.

What is already known about this topic?

U.S. human rabies deaths typically result from contact with rabid bats. Rabies is preventable when postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is promptly administered; once clinical signs develop, the disease is nearly always fatal.

What is added by this report?

A young boy was bitten by a bat; multiple persons knew of the exposure but did not recognize the rabies risk in the absence of a visible bite mark. Medical care was not sought until the child developed signs and symptoms 2 months later. One third of the child’s contacts met exposure criteria, and one quarter sought PEP; no secondary cases were detected.

What are the implications for public health practices?

Enhanced public education about the risk for rabies associated with bat contact and the importance of seeking PEP if contact occurs is needed. In late August 2021, a boy aged 7 years was bitten by a bat while he was playing outside his apartment home in Medina County, Texas. He informed his parents; however, no rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) was sought because there were no visible bite marks, and the family was unaware that contact with a bat, including in the absence of visible bite marks, might cause rabies. Approximately 2 months later, the child was hospitalized for altered mental status, seizures, and hypersalivation and ultimately received a diagnosis of rabies. Experimental therapies were attempted; however, the child died 22 days after symptom onset. Fifty-seven persons who met criteria for suspected or known exposure to infectious secretions in this case were advised to consult with a medical provider about the need for rabies PEP in accordance with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines (1). Rabies, an acute, progressive neuroencephalitis, is nearly always fatal. Although dogs are the most common source of human rabies deaths worldwide and account for an estimated 59,000 annual cases of human rabies globally (2), bats are the most common source of domestically acquired rabies in the United States and have been implicated in 31 (81.6%) of 38 human infections since 2000 (3). Attempts to prevent death or poor neurologic outcomes once rabies symptoms develop have been largely unsuccessful (4). Administration of rabies PEP, comprising rabies immunoglobulin and a series of doses of rabies vaccine, is critical to preventing rabies after an exposure; enhanced public education about the risk posed by bats, and the availability of PEP to prevent rabies, is needed.

On October 21, 2021, the boy aged 7 years was evaluated at a freestanding emergency department (facility A) for a 2-day history of right-hand pruritus and right upper extremity pain. He was given an oral steroid and discharged home. The following day, he was assessed at a different hospital emergency department (facility B) for a rash on the right side of his head, right scapular area, and right hand and arm along with continued pain in his right arm. He received a diagnosis of presumptive herpes zoster (shingles) and was prescribed a 5-day course of acyclovir along with antihistamines and ibuprofen. One day later, on October 23, he returned to facility B with delusions and worsening pruritus of his forehead and was discharged with diazepam for spasms and gabapentin for pain. Later that same day, he returned to facility B with nausea, vomiting, fever of 104°F (40°C), hypersalivation, and change in mental status, including confusion and delusions; he was intubated for airway protection. That evening, he was transferred to facility C, where he was admitted and began treatment with empiric antimicrobial drugs for presumed central nervous system infection. Initial testing included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood cultures and testing for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, enterovirus, mycoplasma, Bartonella, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus; all tests later had negative results. On October 25 (the third day of hospitalization), a diagnosis of rabies was suspected after infectious disease clinicians solicited a detailed history that disclosed the bat bite approximately 2 months earlier. Although the child had reported the bite to parents, no bite marks were seen, and the risk of rabies from bat contact was not considered; therefore, care was not sought. Aggressive intensive care management was initiated in facility C, and the patient began treatment with experimental intrathecal human rabies immune globulin on hospital day 7; however, this regimen was not successful, and the patient died on hospital day 16.

Public Health Investigation

Once rabies was suspected, saliva, nuchal skin biopsy, serum, and CSF were collected and sent to CDC’s National Rabies Reference Laboratory. On October 27, nuchal skin biopsy and saliva specimens confirmed the presence of rabies viral RNA via real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing, confirming rabies virus infection (5,6). Sequencing of viral RNA collected from the patient was consistent with rabies virus found in the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), the most commonly reported rabid animal in Texas (7). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†

Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) interviewed family and community contacts to determine potential exposures to the patient during the infectious period, estimated to have commenced on October 5 (2 weeks before symptom onset) (8). Once the diagnosis was confirmed, persons who met exposure criteria (i.e., suspected or known exposure to infectious secretions) were advised to speak with a medical provider about administration of rabies PEP in accordance with ACIP guidelines (1). Among 10 of the patient’s family members assessed, six met exposure criteria and received PEP (Table). One additional family member elected to receive PEP despite having no reported exposure risk.

The child had attended school and an extracurricular program during his infectious period. DSHS met with school administration and the extracurricular program director to identify persons who could have met exposure criteria (e.g., sharing of food or exertional face-to-face interactions). Among 49 community contacts, 46 met exposure criteria, and 34 contacts sought PEP. Most who sought PEP were students participating in the extracurricular program because they reported close contact during which tears and saliva were potentially exchanged. Local hospitals and physicians were advised of the potential increased demand for PEP.

Infection preventionists at facilities A, B, and C were provided a health care worker rabies risk exposure assessment tool§ that included information about each health care worker’s rabies vaccination status, the amount of time spent with and nature of physical contact with the patient (e.g., kissing or being bitten), and whether there was any contact with the patient’s body fluids while not wearing personal protective equipment. The schedule for rabies PEP was also provided to infection preventionists. Five health care contacts among 118 assessed for exposure risk met exposure criteria; one sought PEP.

Following confirmation that the patient’s exposure was caused by a bat bite outside his residence, DSHS contacted the apartment complex where he had resided and sent email and printed rabies advisories¶ to the residents notifying them of the rabies risk from bats and the availability of treatment for exposed persons. Receipt of the health advisory was confirmed by telephone; among 175 residents, 124 (71%) were successfully contacted. Twenty-four residents reported sightings of bats in or around the complex; none reported physical contact with a bat. Evaluation of interviews from residents who reported bat sightings enabled DSHS and local animal control to identify the bat colony location. Immediate remediation of the colony was advised by DSHS and successfully completed by a pest management company.

After the patient’s death, the funeral home and embalmer were contacted to ascertain the possibility of any further potential rabies exposures. No recommendations for rabies PEP were made because appropriate precautions had been taken (9).

Among the 42 contacts who initiated PEP, all were determined by DSHS to have completed PEP. No additional human rabies exposures or cases have been identified as a result of contact with this patient or the index bat in the apartment complex.

On October 29, 2021, DSHS issued a news release reporting the case and informing the public that at-risk contacts had been identified and were being assessed regarding the need for rabies PEP. General recommendations were provided for preventing rabies such as not approaching wild animals, seeking medical attention after an animal bite or scratch, and ensuring domestic dogs and cats are up to date with rabies vaccination.","Discussion

Bats are a reservoir species for rabies virus in all U.S. states except Hawaii. Bat-mediated human rabies deaths increased in 2021 following 2 years with no confirmed cases (10). In this case, bite marks were not recognized by the patient’s immediate family members, and there was a lack of awareness of the risk for rabies from a bat in the absence of a visible bite mark, resulting in their not seeking medical care as well as a delay in eliciting the exposure history across multiple health systems. Contact with bats, including bites, is typically recognized by the recipient because of the bite force impact, despite many North American bat species typically having small teeth. Bites might not leave observable puncture marks, and given the high risk for rabies virus transmission from bats, PEP is recommended for any bat contact when a bite or scratch cannot be ruled out. Increased public health outreach and education about the rabies risk associated with bats and that rabies is preventable with PEP is needed. As part of its educational effort, Texas DSHS sponsors an annual rabies poster contest for school-aged children.**

Humans shed rabies virus during the clinical phase of disease; however, there has been no confirmed human-to-human transmission of rabies apart from that occurring through organ or tissue transplantation, including in health care settings. Rabies virus is transmitted through direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with saliva, tears, respiratory secretions, and brain or nervous system tissue. Use of standard precautions†† protects health care workers against potential exposure to rabies. In this investigation, compliance with standard COVID-19 precautions§§ at health facilities enabled nearly all health care providers to confidently rule out exposure. However, a significant number of community members received PEP because of possible exposure during the patient’s social activities and lack of reliable information about nature of exposures to the patient from his peers, who were mostly children aged <10 years.

This case serves as a reminder that rabies virus is still present in the United States and that exposures to bats and other mammalian wildlife should always prompt a consultation with public health officials or medical providers. It is important to inform animal control or local public health officials when bats build roosts within and around human dwellings. PEP is highly effective and should be administered as soon as possible after an exposure to prevent rabies.","Corresponding author: Faisal S.

What is already known about this topic?

HIV service use decreased after the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration in March 2020.

What is added by this report?

In 2020, the number of HIV tests and the number of persons prescribed preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) decreased between the first and second calendar quarters but rebounded by the third quarter. The proportion of persons linked to HIV care, the number prescribed antiretroviral therapy, and the proportion with a suppressed viral load among those tested remained stable during the study period.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Innovative service delivery models for HIV testing and PrEP care are needed to ensure that these services are accessible during public health emergencies. Increasing HIV testing, preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are pillars of the federal Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative, with a goal of decreasing new HIV infections by 90% by 2030.* In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a national emergency was declared in the United States on March 13, 2020, resulting in the closure of nonessential businesses and most nonemergency health care venues; stay-at-home orders also limited movement within communities (1). As unemployment increased during the pandemic (2), many persons lost employer-sponsored health insurance (3). HIV testing and PrEP prescriptions declined early in the COVID-19 pandemic (4–6); however, the full impact of the pandemic on use of HIV prevention and care services and HIV outcomes is not known. To assess changes in these measures during 2019–2021, quarterly data from two large U.S. commercial laboratories, the IQVIA Real World Data — Longitudinal Prescription Database (IQVIA),† and the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS)§ were analyzed. During quarter 1 (Q1)¶ 2020, a total of 2,471,614 HIV tests were performed, 190,955 persons were prescribed PrEP, and 8,438 persons received a diagnosis of HIV infection. Decreases were observed during quarter 2 (Q2), with 1,682,578 HIV tests performed (32% decrease), 179,280 persons prescribed PrEP (6% decrease), and 6,228 persons receiving an HIV diagnosis (26% decrease). Partial rebounds were observed during quarter 3 (Q3), with 2,325,554 HIV tests performed, 184,320 persons prescribed PrEP, and 7,905 persons receiving an HIV diagnosis. The proportion of persons linked to HIV care, the number who were prescribed ART, and proportion with a suppressed viral load test (<200 copies of HIV RNA per mL) among those tested were stable during the study period. During public health emergencies, delivery of HIV services outside of traditional clinical settings or that use nonclinical delivery models are needed to facilitate access to HIV testing, ART, and PrEP, as well as to support adherence to ART and PrEP medications.

Data from four data sources were used to estimate HIV service use and outcomes by quarter: 1) LabCorp, 2) Quest Diagnostics, 3) IQVIA, and 4) NHSS. Combined LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics laboratory data were analyzed to estimate the number of HIV tests performed during 2019–2021; Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify HIV antigen and antibody test results and HIV RNA test results. Laboratory data were also used to estimate the number of HIV viral load tests performed and the proportion of those tests indicating viral load suppression. IQVIA data on antiretroviral drugs dispensed by U.S. retail pharmacies and mail-order pharmacies during 2019–2021 were analyzed using a validated algorithm to estimate the number of persons prescribed PrEP or ART (7). Laboratory and IQVIA data were analyzed to assess the change from each quarter to the following quarter in the number of HIV tests and persons prescribed PrEP during 2019–2021, stratified by age group (15–24, 25–34, and ≥35 years). NHSS data from 2019–2020 were analyzed to identify the number of persons who received a diagnosis of HIV infection and the proportion of those persons linked to care within 1 month of diagnosis** as well as to assess the quarterly change in the number of persons who received an HIV diagnosis during 2019–2020, by age group, race and ethnicity, and transmission category. Incomplete race and ethnicity data and no transmission data were available in either the laboratory or IQVIA data; in addition, the number of persons who received an HIV diagnosis and the percentage linked to care were not available for 2021. Poisson regression models were used to assess trends in service use and outcomes by calculating the estimated quarterly percent change (EQPC) during 2019–2021 and 95% CIs; these models were also used to assess whether changes in the number of HIV tests and number of persons prescribed PrEP from Q1 to Q2 during 2020 differed significantly among age groups. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††

The number of HIV tests and number of persons prescribed PrEP decreased early in the COVID-19 pandemic but started to rebound by mid-2020. During 2020, the number of HIV tests decreased 32% from Q1 (2,471,614) to Q2 (1,682,578) but increased in Q3 to 2,325,554 (2019–2021 EQPC = 0.33%) (Table 1). Similarly, during 2020, the number of persons prescribed PrEP decreased 6% from Q1 (190,955) to Q2 (179,280) but increased to 184,320 in Q3 (2019–2021 EQPC = 3.45%). Following a similar pattern, during 2020, HIV diagnoses decreased 6% from Q1 (8,438) to Q2 (6,228) but increased to 7,905 in Q3 (2019–2020 EQPC = −3.99%). The proportion of persons linked to HIV care, the number who were prescribed ART, and the proportion with a suppressed viral load test result among those tested was stable during the study period. Among persons who received a diagnosis of HIV infection, the percentage who were linked to care did not vary during 2019–2020, ranging from 88.0% to 89.4% (2019–2020 EQPC = 0.24%). During 2020, viral load tests performed decreased 20% from Q1 (259,026) to Q2 (206,586) but increased to 252,643 in Q3 (2019–2021 EQPC = 0.45%). The number of persons prescribed ART did not vary (2019–2021 EQPC = 0.24%). Similarly, the proportion of tests indicating viral load suppression did not vary and ranged from 86.7% to 89.0% (2019–2021 EQPC = 0.26%).

During 2020, among all age groups, persons aged ≥35 years experienced the largest quarter-to-quarter decrease in number of HIV tests from Q1 (1,076,548) to Q2 (660,593), representing a 39% decline (Figure). During the same period, persons aged 15–24 years experienced the largest quarter-to-quarter decrease in receipt of PrEP prescriptions (from 17,909 to 16,316, a 9% decrease). Among all racial and ethnic groups and HIV transmission categories, the number of persons who received a diagnosis of HIV infection in 2020 decreased from Q1 to Q2 (range = −21.1 [White] to −29.4 [Other] and −25.7 [male-to-male sexual contact and heterosexual contact, females] to −29.0 [heterosexual contact, males]) and then partially rebounded in Q3 (Table 2).","Discussion

Compared with the performance of the U.S. HIV prevention and care service system before the COVID-19 pandemic, the system performed as well as it did during the first 2 years of the pandemic when access to services decreased as a result of shutdowns and loss of employer-sponsored health insurance (1–3). HIV testing and PrEP prescriptions were disrupted during Q2 2020 but rebounded during Q3 after which PrEP prescriptions followed prepandemic trends, increasing each quarter through 2021. The decrease in HIV diagnoses might be attributable to decreases in HIV testing as well as decreases in transmission during the pandemic. Despite the decline in HIV diagnoses, similar proportions of persons receiving a diagnosis were linked to care compared with prepandemic proportions. Although viral load tests decreased in Q2 2020, ART prescriptions remained stable, suggesting that prescriptions were provided without recommended viral load testing.§§ This is consistent with guidelines recommending providers and their patients to weigh the risks and benefits of in-person care, including visits for laboratory testing, during periods of high COVID-19 community transmission.¶¶

Interventions to increase HIV testing and PrEP use outside of clinical settings were being implemented in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and can be expanded during future public health emergencies or other periods of decreased health care access. HIV and PrEP self-test kits are in various stages of development, evaluation, and distribution (8–10). The use of such testing kits, along with health service models that include telehealth clinical services and an expanded role for pharmacies, can provide opportunities for PrEP initiation and continued use over time during periods of decreased access to health care venues.

In 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act appropriated $90 million to Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) recipients to facilitate response to clients’ COVID-19–related health service needs.*** The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) waived certain administrative requirements for RWHAP recipients and subrecipients. These include eligible clients be persons with HIV infection, so that COVID-19 prevention measures could be provided to close contacts who did not have HIV; penalty provisions, including requirements for obligation of funds and core medical services budgets; and the requirement for a nominal charge for clients with incomes above the federal poverty level. Recipients were encouraged to be flexible in client eligibility determinations and recertification processes, including adoption of self-attestation and electronic signatures for jurisdictions that did not already use them. HRSA HAB encouraged adoption of telehealth services and mobile technology to increase access to services.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, although HIV antigen and antibody and viral load tests were not nationally representative, they included more than one half of laboratory tests performed in the United States. Second, IQVIA data were not nationally representative but included prescriptions from 93% of retail pharmacies and 77% of mail-order pharmacies. Third, HIV and viral load testing data were not deduplicated across LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. A person might have had more than one test result, resulting in an overestimation of persons with an HIV or viral load test result. Finally, viral suppression estimates did not include persons out of care; these persons might have been less likely to be virally suppressed. The viral suppression method in this study differs from the viral suppression measure used to monitor the EHE initiative, which is calculated using NHSS data on all persons with diagnosed HIV infection in the United States. However, viral suppression rates in this study are similar to EHE initiative measures for persons who received care or a viral load test.

The HIV prevention and care service system was resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although HIV testing and PrEP services were disrupted in the spring of 2020, these services started to rebound by summer 2020; ART services for treatment remained unchanged because of interventions such as telehealth and ART home delivery. HIV testing and PrEP provision using self-test kits and nonclinical delivery models are needed to ensure robust prevention services during public health emergencies. Data on the impact of disrupted services and outcomes during the pandemic, along with risk behavior change data, can be used in models to predict the impact on HIV transmission and delays in achieving goals of the EHE initiative. Communities can use this information to assess resources and activities needed to offset decreased prevention services during the pandemic.","Corresponding author: Karen W.

B. pseudomallei can infect humans and a wide range of animals through percutaneous inoculation, inhalation, or ingestion (1). Melioidosis symptoms are nonspecific and vary widely because B. pseudomallei can infect any organ of the body, including the brain. In October 2021, the source of a multistate outbreak of melioidosis that involved four human cases in Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas was identified as an aromatherapy room spray imported from India* (2).

After the discovery of the aromatherapy spray as the outbreak source, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) learned that a previously healthy pet raccoon, owned by the family of the Texas patient, had broken a bottle of the implicated aromatherapy spray and walked through the liquid. On April 3, 2021, approximately 2 weeks after this exposure, the raccoon displayed acute neurologic symptoms consistent with neurologic melioidosis† and died from an undetermined cause 3 days later. The carcass was wrapped in a cloth robe and buried on the family’s property. The strain found in the aromatherapy bottle (ATS2021) and linked to the outbreak contained a genetic variant, the bimABm allele, which is a virulence factor associated with neurologic melioidosis (3).

Environmental suitability modeling studies for B. pseudomallei suggest that the soil and climate in parts of Texas are suitable for B. pseudomallei (1). Because of concerns about establishment of B. pseudomallei in soil within a setting where the pathogen is not known to be endemic, and out of an abundance of caution, staff members from Texas DSHS Region 2/3, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 6, and CDC traveled to the Texas property on April 19, 2022, to determine whether there was evidence of B. pseudomallei contamination and to decontaminate the burial site. Thirty-two environmental samples§ were collected from the burial site and surrounding area, including soil, tree root fragments, and water from a stream downhill from the site. Soil samples were collected directly above, below, and adjacent to the carcass; 10 radial soil samples were collected at 2-, 4-, and 6-ft (0.6-, 1.2-, and 1.8-m) intervals around the carcass, oriented toward the natural drainage path, down to the stream (Figure). The raccoon carcass was found at a depth of approximately 1 ft (30 cm), and 12 tissue samples were collected during field necropsy.¶ After sampling, EPA staff members immediately decontaminated the carcass and excavated soil within a 2-ft (0.6-m) circumference of the carcass in germicidal bleach (8.25% sodium hypochlorite, diluted 1:3 with water) overnight for approximately 15 hours (4). All samples were tested for B. pseudomallei by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cultured by CDC. A portion of four of the 12 tissue samples were formalin-fixed by the Dallas County Health and Human Services Laboratory in Texas and tested for B. pseudomallei by immunohistochemistry (IHC) at CDC.

Two swabs collected from the raccoon’s intraorbital tissue tested positive by PCR for the presence of B. pseudomallei DNA; however, viable B. pseudomallei was not cultured. All other tissue samples tested negative by PCR or IHC.** No environmental contamination was detected, with all environmental samples testing negative for B. pseudomallei by both PCR and culture.

The positive PCR result for B. pseduomallei from the raccoon tissue reaffirmed the suspicion that the racoon likely died of acute neurological melioidosis. This is the first reported presumed melioidosis case documented in a raccoon and the first animal case linked to this outbreak. Although the bacteria could not be cultured and sequenced, the raccoon was most likely infected by the outbreak strain given the animal’s exposure history and that B. pseudomallei has never been isolated from Texas soil. Melioidosis is typically not transmitted from animals to humans; however, it does infect a diverse range of animals including mammals, reptiles, and fish (1,5). This investigation identified no evidence of environmental contamination by B. pseudomallei from the buried carcass; such investigations are important in preventing potential establishment of B. pseudomallei in soil within a setting where the pathogen is not known to be endemic.",,"Corresponding author: Julia K.

What is already known about this topic?

Frozen stuffed chicken products remain a source of Salmonella outbreaks despite changes to packaging instructing consumers to cook these products in ovens and to avoid using microwaves.

What is added by this report?

More than one half of respondents to an Internet panel survey reported using an appliance other than an oven to cook frozen stuffed chicken products; 29% used a microwave. Respondents with lower incomes and who live in mobile types of homes reported lower oven use and higher microwave use.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Economic and other factors might influence access to recommended cooking appliances. Companies could consider implementing interventions that rely less on labeling and consumer preparation practices to ensure safety. Frozen stuffed breaded raw chicken products have repeatedly been implicated in Salmonella outbreaks (1). These products are partially cooked to set the breading, often making them appear cooked (2). Despite their appearance, these products need to be cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) to ensure that they are safe to eat. Producers began implementing labeling changes in 2006 to more clearly identify these products as raw; many warn against using microwave ovens (microwaves) to prepare them and provide validated cooking instructions solely for conventional ovens (ovens) (3,4). However, outbreaks continued to occur after implementation of these labeling changes (4). To describe the demographic characteristics of persons who prepare frozen stuffed chicken products and which appliances they use to prepare them, data from a May–July 2022 representative panel survey were analyzed. Although most (82.7%) respondents used an oven as one of their cooking methods, more than one half (54.0%) of respondents also used another appliance, including 29.0% who used a microwave. Oven use was lower among respondents with household income <$25,000 (68.9%), and who lived in mobile homes or other portable types of homes (66.5%). Among respondents who reported using microwaves to cook these products, 8% reported using a microwave with ≤750 W of power, which might be insufficient to thoroughly cook such products (1,5,6). Economic and other factors might influence some groups’ access to recommended cooking appliances. Companies could consider implementing additional interventions that rely less on labeling and consumer preparation practices and focus on controlling or reducing levels of Salmonella in these products, such as selling them fully cooked, or monitoring and testing Salmonella levels, to ensure safety. These findings highlight challenges consumers might face in preparing frozen stuffed chicken products safely and can guide strategies for regulatory authorities and industry to prevent outbreaks and illnesses associated with them.

During May 31–July 6, 2022, Porter Novelli Public Services conducted the SummerStyles survey using the Ipsos KnowledgePanel. Panel members are recruited nationwide by mail using probability-based sampling by address and are provided with a laptop or tablet and access to the Internet if needed. Among 5,990 members invited to participate, 4,156 (69.3%) completed the survey. Fourteen respondents did not provide responses to the questions of interest, resulting in a final sample of 4,142.

To assess use of cooking appliances to prepare frozen stuffed chicken products, respondents were asked, “What appliances do you use to prepare frozen stuffed chicken products, such as chicken stuffed with broccoli and cheese, chicken cordon bleu, or chicken Kiev?” followed by a list of appliances, or an option to select “I don’t eat these products.” Respondents could select more than one appliance. To assess respondents’ knowledge of their microwaves’ wattage, respondents were asked, “What is the wattage of your household microwave?” To align with the U.S. population distribution, the sample was weighted by sex, age group, household income, race and ethnicity, household size, whether the respondent was the parent of a child or adolescent aged 11–17 years, educational attainment, U.S. Census Bureau region,† and metropolitan status.

Point estimates and 95% CIs were calculated overall and by demographic characteristic (age group, sex, race and ethnicity, U.S. Census Bureau region, household income, highest educational attainment, home type, home ownership, and health insurance status) and compared among respondents who did and did not report preparing frozen stuffed chicken products, and among those who did, the appliances they used and their knowledge of microwave wattage, using Wald chi-square tests. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All weighted analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§

Among 4,142 adults who participated in this survey, 2,546 (61.5%) reported preparing frozen stuffed chicken products (Table 1). start highlightRespondents reporting preparing the product, compared with those who did not prepare the product, included a higher proportion of men (50.8% versus 44.4%), and a lower proportion of respondents aged ≥ 60 years (29.1% versus 35.1%). A lower proportion of respondents who lived in the U.S. Census Bureau West Region (21.8% versus 27.4%) reported preparing the product, compared with those who did not prepare the product.end highlight

Overall, 2,107 (82.7%) of the 2,546 respondents reported using an oven as one of the cooking appliances used for preparing frozen stuffed chicken products (Table 2). Oven usage was lower among respondents with an annual household income of <$25,000 (68.9%) than among those with household incomes ≥$25,000 (84.9%; p<0.001), those who completed some college or less (80.4%) than among those who completed college (87.2%; p = 0.0002), respondents living in mobile homes, recreational vehicles, boats, vans, or other types of home (66.5%) compared with those living in a one-family house, townhouse, condominium, or apartment (83.5%; p = 0.014), and among those who occupied their home without payment of rent¶ (63.1%) compared with those who owned or rented their home (83.1%; p = 0.037).

More than one half (54.0%) of respondents reported preparing frozen stuffed chicken products using appliances other than or in addition to ovens, including air fryers (29.7%), microwaves (29.0%), toaster ovens (13.7%), or another appliance (3.8%). Microwave usage was higher among men (33.7%), respondents with household incomes <$25,000 (37.2%), and those who occupied their home without payment of rent (49.9%), compared with women (24.2%; p≤0.001), respondents with incomes ≥$25,000 (27.7%; p = 0.011), and those who rented or owned their home (28.5%; p = 0.031).

Among 730 respondents who reported using a microwave to prepare frozen stuffed chicken products, approximately one third (34%) did not know the wattage of their microwave (Figure). A higher percentage of respondents aged 18–29 years did not know their microwave’s wattage (46%) compared with respondents aged ≥30 years (31%; p = 0.03). Overall, 8% of respondents who reported preparing frozen stuffed chicken products using a microwave had microwaves with a power level ≤750 W.","Discussion

Although ovens were the most commonly reported appliance used to cook frozen stuffed chicken products, more than one half of respondents (54.0%) reported using other appliances instead of or in addition to ovens, including microwaves (29.0%), a circumstance that historically has been reported frequently by ill persons in outbreaks associated with frozen stuffed chicken products (1). Respondents with lower incomes and who live in mobile types of homes reported lower oven use and higher microwave use. Persons within these groups might be at increased risk for illness related to both challenges in preparing these foods and access to appliances.

Efforts to prevent Salmonella infections linked to frozen stuffed chicken products have relied on manufacturers to develop validated cooking instructions and labeling to alert the consumer to which appliances are recommended to cook them (i.e., ovens). Studies indicate that microwaves, air fryers, and toaster ovens inconsistently heat frozen stuffed chicken or frozen raw breaded chicken (4,6,7). Therefore, cooking instructions often do not include information about cooking the product in air fryers or toaster ovens and might warn against using microwaves. However, previous studies have found that some consumers infrequently read package instructions (8,9), including one report that found some consumers discarded packaging when the products were brought home and never saw cooking instructions (9). In this survey, 30% of respondents reported using an air fryer, 29% a microwave, and 14% a toaster oven. These findings suggest that relying on labeling and cooking instructions might not be sufficient to prevent illness. Further, even when cooking these products in an oven, verifying the temperature of the finished product is important (7). However, food thermometer usage can be low; one study found that even among persons who owned a food thermometer, only 38% typically used them to check doneness of frozen chicken products (2).

Preparing frozen stuffed chicken products in an oven requires access to a working oven. In this survey, persons with lower income, who live in mobile types of homes, and who live in their home without payment of rent reported lower oven use. Persons who live in mobile types of homes might have less or insufficient space for a conventional oven. Appliances like microwaves are small, often portable, and cost less to own and operate than an oven. These findings suggest that economic and other factors might influence some groups’ access to recommended cooking appliances.

Barriers to using ovens, combined with the convenience of microwaves’ shorter cooking times, might encourage consumers to use microwaves. Microwaves require adjusting cooking times based on the microwave’s wattage. Consumers who do not know their microwave’s wattage, as was the case among approximately one third of respondents in this survey, might not be able to adjust cooking times and might therefore be less likely to prepare these products safely. In addition, 8% of all respondents who reported using a microwave to prepare these products and knew the wattage had microwaves with a power level ≤750 W. Studies suggest that lower wattage microwaves might be insufficient to cook these products (1,5,6).

Current measures to prevent Salmonella infections linked to contaminated frozen raw stuffed chicken products rely on consumers’ ability to identify them as raw, to read and recall cooking instructions, to adequately cook the products according to validated cooking instructions, typically in conventional ovens, and to verify the product’s internal temperature using a food thermometer. Results from this survey highlight possible challenges consumers face preparing these products safely and the need for additional action. Given the substantial percentage of respondents who reported using an appliance other than an oven, and socioeconomic characteristics of respondents with lower oven usage, companies could consider implementing additional interventions that rely less on labeling and consumer preparation practices and instead control or reduce levels of Salmonella in these products, such as selling them fully cooked, or monitoring and testing Salmonella levels, to ensure safety.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, responses were self-reported and therefore subject to recall and social desirability biases. Second, although weighted to represent the U.S. population, the survey sample might not be representative. Third, the survey did not specify raw frozen stuffed chicken products; therefore, consumers possibly reported appliances that they use to prepare fully cooked stuffed chicken products. However, previous studies indicate that some consumers might be unaware that these products are usually raw (2). Finally, the survey did not include questions about whether cooking instructions were noticed or followed, or which appliances respondents owned; therefore, reasons that specific appliances were used could not be assessed.

Although Salmonella has not historically been considered an adulterant in not-ready-to-eat products, including raw frozen stuffed chicken products, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service recently announced its intention to declare it an adulterant in these products (10). These findings can guide regulatory policy and prevention strategies for the industry.","Corresponding author: Katherine E.

What is already known about this topic?

Monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were less effective against symptomatic infection during the period of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant predominance.

What is added by this report?

In this study of vaccine effectiveness of the U.S.-authorized bivalent mRNA booster formulations, bivalent boosters provided significant additional protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons who had previously received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses. Due to waning immunity of monovalent doses, the benefit of the bivalent booster increased with time since receipt of the most recent monovalent vaccine dose.

What are the implications for public health practice?

All persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, including bivalent booster doses for eligible persons. On September 1, 2022, bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, composed of components from the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains, were recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to address reduced effectiveness of COVID-19 monovalent vaccines during SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant predominance (1). Initial recommendations included persons aged ≥12 years (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ≥18 years (Moderna) who had completed at least a primary series of any Food and Drug Administration–authorized or –approved monovalent vaccine ≥2 months earlier (1). On October 12, 2022, the recommendation was expanded to include children aged 5–11 years. At the time of recommendation, immunogenicity data were available from clinical trials of bivalent vaccines composed of ancestral and Omicron BA.1 strains; however, no clinical efficacy data were available. In this study, effectiveness of the bivalent (Omicron BA.4/BA.5–containing) booster formulation against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was examined using data from the Increasing Community Access to Testing (ICATT) national SARS-CoV-2 testing program.* During September 14–November 11, 2022, a total of 360,626 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) performed at 9,995 retail pharmacies for adults aged ≥18 years, who reported symptoms consistent with COVID-19 at the time of testing and no immunocompromising conditions, were included in the analysis. Relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of a bivalent booster dose compared with that of ≥2 monovalent vaccine doses among persons for whom 2–3 months and ≥8 months had elapsed since last monovalent dose was 30% and 56% among persons aged 18–49 years, 31% and 48% among persons aged 50–64 years, and 28% and 43% among persons aged ≥65 years, respectively. Bivalent mRNA booster doses provide additional protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompetent persons who previously received monovalent vaccine only, with relative benefits increasing with time since receipt of the most recent monovalent vaccine dose. Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including getting a bivalent booster dose when eligible, is critical to maximizing protection against COVID-19 (1).

The ICATT program was designed to increase access to COVID-19 testing in areas with high social vulnerability† through contracts with retail pharmacy chains to provide SARS-CoV-2 testing at no cost to the recipient at selected sites nationwide (2). ICATT vaccine effectiveness (VE) methods have been described previously (3). Briefly, at test registration, adults report their vaccination history§ and information on current COVID-19 symptoms, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and underlying medical conditions. Adults receiving testing at participating sites during September 14–November 11, 2022, (when Omicron variant BA.4/BA.5 lineages and their sublineages predominated¶) who reported one or more COVID-19–compatible symptoms were included; case-patients were persons who received a positive rapid or laboratory-based NAAT result; control-patients were those who received a negative NAAT result. Tests from persons who reported an immunocompromising condition (4), who received non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, who had received only a single monovalent mRNA vaccine dose or >4 monovalent mRNA doses, or who had received their last monovalent dose <2 months before the SARS-CoV-2 test were excluded from analyses.** In addition, tests from persons who reported a positive result during the preceding 90 days†† were excluded to avoid analyzing repeated tests for the same illness episode or reinfections within a relatively short time frame. Absolute VE (aVE) was calculated by comparing the odds of receipt of a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses) to being unvaccinated (zero doses of any COVID-19 vaccine) among case- and control-patients. rVE was calculated by comparing the odds of receiving a bivalent booster dose (after 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses) versus not receiving a bivalent booster dose (but receiving 2, 3, or 4 monovalent doses). To explore how waning of protection after receipt of the most recent monovalent vaccine dose influenced the measured relative effectiveness of a subsequent bivalent booster dose, rVE of a bivalent booster dose was calculated by interval since receipt of the most recent monovalent vaccine dose among those who had not received a bivalent booster (2–3 months, 4–5 months, 6–7 months, and ≥8 months). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using multivariable logistic regression§§; VE was calculated as (1 − OR) x 100. Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.2; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶

Among persons aged ≥18 years reporting COVID-19–compatible symptoms, 360,626 tests were included; of these, 121,687 (34%) persons received positive test results (Table 1). Among these case-patients, 28,874 (24%) reported being unvaccinated, 87,013 (72%) had received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses but no bivalent booster dose, and 5,800 (5%) had received a bivalent booster dose. Among 238,939 control-patients who received negative test results, 72,010 (30%) reported being unvaccinated, 150,455 (63%) had received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses but no bivalent booster dose, and 16,474 (7%) had received a bivalent booster dose. Median interval between receipt of the bivalent booster dose and SARS-CoV-2 testing was 1 month (range = 0–2 months) and did not vary by case status. Self-reported infection >90 days before the current test was more common among persons who received a negative test result (43%) than among those who received a positive test result (22%).

aVE of a bivalent booster dose received after ≥2 monovalent doses (compared with being unvaccinated) was similar among persons aged 50–64 years (28%) and ≥65 years (22%) but varied somewhat by number of previous monovalent vaccine doses (Table 2). Among adults aged 18–49 years, aVE after ≥2 monovalent doses (43%) was higher than that for older age groups and did not vary among those who received 2 or 3 previous monovalent vaccine doses.

Among persons who received ≥2 monovalent vaccine doses, rVE increased with time since the most recent monovalent vaccine dose in all age groups (Table 3). At 2–3 months and ≥8 months after receipt of the most recent monovalent dose, rVE of a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose was 30% and 56% among persons aged 18–49 years, 31% and 48% among persons aged 50–64 years, and 28% and 43% among persons aged ≥65 years, respectively.","Discussion

Among symptomatic adults who received testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection at pharmacies nationwide during September 14–November 11, 2022, bivalent mRNA vaccines provided additional protection against infection compared with previous vaccination with 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccines alone. These are the first published estimates of VE for newly authorized bivalent mRNA booster vaccines. In this study, relative benefits of a bivalent booster compared with monovalent vaccine doses alone increased with time since receipt of last monovalent dose.

Postauthorization immunogenicity studies have shown similar neutralizing antibody titers to BA.4/BA.5 after receipt of either a monovalent or BA.4/BA.5–containing bivalent vaccine as a fourth dose (5,6); however, immunogenicity studies are not generally designed to measure clinical impact. Findings from this real-world VE study indicate that the bivalent formulations authorized in the United States provide additional protection when administered to persons who previously received 2, 3, or 4 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccines.

Waning VE with time since monovalent vaccine receipt has been observed during the Omicron-predominant period, with more rapid waning during the period when Omicron BA.4/BA.5 lineages predominated.*** Results from this study show that bivalent boosters provide protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during circulation of BA.4/BA.5 and their sublineages and restore protection observed to wane after monovalent vaccine receipt, as demonstrated by increased rVE with longer time since the most recent monovalent dose. Most tests (81%) in this study were conducted during a period of BA.4/BA.5 predominance. Results limited to the period of BA.4/BA.5 predominance were not meaningfully different from the results shown, which include data from the period when BA.4/BA.5 sublineages (including BA.4.6, BA.5.2.6, BF.7, BQ.1, and BQ.1.1) predominated.

This study evaluated aVE and rVE by number of previous monovalent doses received and generally found similar additional benefit of the bivalent vaccine regardless of the number of previous monovalent vaccine doses received, when controlling for time since receipt of the last monovalent dose. These findings support the current COVID-19 vaccination policy recommending a bivalent booster dose for adults who have completed at least a primary mRNA vaccination series, irrespective of the number of monovalent doses previously received.

In the United States, >90% of adults have received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose.††† Therefore, aVE should be interpreted with caution because unvaccinated persons might have different behaviors or a fundamentally different risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with vaccinated persons. aVE in this study appeared lower in persons aged ≥50 years who received 3 or 4 monovalent doses before a bivalent booster dose compared with those who received only 2 monovalent doses before a bivalent booster dose; this might be because of differential rates of previous infection or differences in behaviors in those who had not previously received a booster dose compared with those who remained up to date with previous booster dose recommendations.

The findings in this study are subject to at least six limitations. First, vaccination status, previous infection history, and underlying medical conditions were self-reported and might be subject to recall bias. In particular, if previous infection provides protection against repeat infection, then VE estimates in this study would likely be biased toward the null, because self-reported previous infection differed by vaccination status, and statistical power was not sufficient to stratify VE estimates by presence of previous infection. In addition, previous infection might have been underreported (7). Second, acceptance of bivalent booster doses to date has been low (approximately 10% of persons aged ≥5 years as of November 15, 2022),§§§ which could bias the results if persons getting vaccinated early are systematically different from those vaccinated later. Third, important data including SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk and mask use were not collected, which might result in residual confounding. Fourth, the circulating variants in the United States continue to change, and results of this study might not be generalizable to future variants. Fifth, tests used in this study were collected predominantly (although not exclusively) in areas with higher social vulnerability; therefore, data might not be fully representative of the broader U.S. population. Finally, these results might be susceptible to bias because of differences in testing behaviors between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons.

In this study of immunocompetent persons tested at ICATT locations, bivalent booster doses provided significant additional protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period when Omicron variant BA.4/BA.5 lineages and their sublineages predominated. All persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, including bivalent booster doses, if it has been ≥2 months since their last monovalent vaccine dose (1).","Corresponding author: Ruth Link-Gelles, media@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Link-Gelles R, Ciesla AA, Fleming-Dutra KE, et al.

What is already known about this topic?

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is an outpatient antiviral medication recommended for adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who have elevated risk of severe illness.

What is added by this report?

Among U.S. adults diagnosed with COVID-19, including those with previous infection or vaccination, persons who were prescribed Paxlovid within 5 days of diagnosis had a 51% lower hospitalization rate within 30 days after diagnosis than those who were not prescribed Paxlovid.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Paxlovid should be offered to eligible adults irrespective of vaccination status, especially in groups with the highest risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as older adults and those with multiple underlying health conditions. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral treatment, is authorized for adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at increased risk for progression to severe illness. However, real-world evidence on the benefit of Paxlovid, according to vaccination status, age group, and underlying health conditions, is limited. To examine the benefit of Paxlovid in adults aged ≥18 years in the United States, a large electronic health record (EHR) data set (Cosmos†) was analyzed to assess the association between receiving a prescription for Paxlovid and hospitalization with a COVID-19 diagnosis in the ensuing 30 days. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate this association, adjusted for demographic characteristics, geographic location, vaccination, previous infection, and number of underlying health conditions. Among 699,848 adults aged ≥18 years eligible for Paxlovid during April–August 2022, 28.4% received a Paxlovid prescription within 5 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Being prescribed Paxlovid was associated with a lower hospitalization rate among the overall study population (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.49), among those who had received ≥3 mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (aHR = 0.50), and across age groups (18–49 years: aHR = 0.59; 50–64 years: aHR = 0.40; and ≥65 years: aHR = 0.53). Paxlovid should be prescribed to eligible adults to reduce the risk of COVID-19–associated hospitalization.

Paxlovid is an oral antiviral medication that received Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration on December 22, 2021 (1), for use in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe illness. Eligibility for Paxlovid includes 1) receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (including home antigen test), 2) symptoms consistent with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, 3) symptom onset within the past 5 days, 4) age ≥18 years (or age ≥12 years and weight ≥40 kg), 5) one or more risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19, 6) no known or suspected severe renal or hepatic impairment, 7) no history of clinically significant reactions (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to the active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or other components of the product, and 8) no contraindicated medications.§

A retrospective analysis was performed on patient records included in Cosmos, a data set that includes EHR information from >160 million persons in U.S. health systems covered by Epic, a health care software company (https://cosmos.epic.com). Inclusion criteria comprised 1) diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during April 1–August 31, 2022¶; 2) an outpatient encounter (telemedicine, in-person, urgent care, emergency department, or other)** associated with the COVID-19 diagnosis; 3) at least one previous face-to-face encounter in Cosmos during the 3 years preceding the COVID-19 diagnosis††; 4) age ≥50 years, or ≥18 years with a documented underlying health condition based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes or medical record fields§§; 5) not known to be pregnant; and 6) not known to have pharmacologic or medical contraindications to Paxlovid use.¶¶ For patients with multiple SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study period, only data from the first infection were used in the analysis; date of diagnosis (earliest COVID-19 diagnosis code or positive SARS-CoV-2 test result) was used as a proxy for symptom onset, and Paxlovid receipt was defined as receiving a prescription for Paxlovid during the 5 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.*** The primary outcome was overnight COVID-19 hospitalization during the 30 days after the date of diagnosis; secondary outcomes were all-cause hospitalization and acute respiratory illness (ARI)–associated hospitalization.†††

Association between Paxlovid receipt and subsequent hospitalization was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model, including age group, sex, race and ethnicity, social vulnerability index,§§§ number of underlying health conditions, U.S. Census Bureau region of residence, previous COVID-19 infection, and COVID-19 vaccination status.¶¶¶ In-hospital COVID-19 mortality during an admission commencing during the 30-day follow-up period was described but not used as an analytic outcome because of concern about underascertainment. Persons receiving Paxlovid contributed unexposed time until the prescription date and exposed time after the prescription date; those not receiving Paxlovid contributed unexposed time. Follow-up time ended when a hospitalization occurred or at 30 days after diagnosis, whichever came first. To assess possible bias related to symptom severity at diagnosis, primary analyses were repeated either excluding telemedicine visits, or excluding patients hospitalized during the 2 days after diagnosis. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.****

Among 1,713,120 persons aged ≥18 years with a COVID-19 diagnosis during April 1–August 31, 2022, 699,848 (40.9%) met the inclusion criteria, including 198,927 who received Paxlovid within 5 days after diagnosis and 500,921 who did not (Figure). Among all persons with COVID-19 who were eligible for Paxlovid, 15.0% had documentation of previous infection and 68.8% were confirmed to have received ≥2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses. Overall, 28.4% of eligible persons received Paxlovid. Paxlovid recipients were more likely to have a telehealth encounter (49.1%) than nonrecipients (18.4%, standardized mean difference = 0.69). Prevalences of underlying health conditions were similar among Paxlovid recipients and nonrecipients (Table 1), and 92.4% had at least one underlying condition. Persons who were immunocompromised†††† accounted for 9.4% (64,911) of the study population, 30.2% of whom received Paxlovid. During the 30 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis, 5,229 (0.75%) persons were hospitalized; 3,311 (63.3%) of these hospitalizations occurred among persons aged ≥65 years. Among the 198,927 Paxlovid recipients, 930 (0.47%) were hospitalized,§§§§ compared with 4,299 (0.86%) of nonrecipients. Among the 5,229 persons with a COVID-19 hospitalization, 930 (17.8%) received Paxlovid during the 5 days after diagnosis. Overall, 211 deaths were reported during a COVID-19 hospitalization. Among those who received Paxlovid, 0.01% (29 of 198,927) died compared with 0.04% (182 of 500,921) of persons who did not receive Paxlovid.

Paxlovid receipt was associated with protection against hospitalization overall (aHR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.46–0.53) (Table 2), including among persons who had received ≥3 mRNA vaccine doses (0.50, 95% CI = 0.45–0.55) and 2 previous mRNA vaccine doses (0.50, 95% CI = 0.42–0.58). Paxlovid receipt was associated with lower hospitalization rates among persons aged 18–49 years (aHR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.48–0.71), 50–64 years (0.40, 95% CI = 0.34–0.48), and ≥65 years (0.53, 95% CI = 0.48–0.58). Among persons aged 18–49 years, Paxlovid receipt was associated with lower hospitalization rates among persons who had received ≥3 mRNA vaccine doses (aHR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.53–1.06) and those with only one underlying health condition (aHR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.58–1.44), but these estimates did not reach statistical significance. Estimated protection by Paxlovid was similar by month of diagnosis. Findings from sensitivity analyses, excluding telemedicine encounters and patients hospitalized during the first 2 days after diagnosis, also indicated significant reduction in hospitalization among Paxlovid recipients.¶¶¶¶ In the analysis of secondary outcomes, among the overall study population, Paxlovid receipt was associated with a lower rate of all-cause hospitalization (aHR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.43–0.48) and ARI-associated hospitalization (aHR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.45–0.51).","Discussion

In a sample of U.S. COVID-19 patients, many of whom had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or were vaccinated against COVID-19, the overall COVID-19 hospitalization rate was 51% lower among those who had received a prescription for Paxlovid for presumed mild-to-moderate COVID-19, compared with those who did not. Similar benefit was seen among persons who had received ≥2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses. The initial randomized clinical trial of Paxlovid, which showed an 89% reduction in severe COVID-19 outcomes, was conducted in unvaccinated persons with no previous infection during the period preceding Omicron variant predominance (2). This real-word analysis demonstrated that being prescribed Paxlovid is associated with a substantially reduced hospitalization risk among persons with previous immunity from infection or vaccination in the setting of the current circulating Omicron subvariants. These findings parallel those of other studies indicating added protection from Paxlovid even among persons with previous infection or vaccination (3–8). Paxlovid conferred stable protection during a period in which multiple Omicron subvariants predominated in the United States. Protection against different predominant SARS-CoV-2 subvariants is consistent with Paxlovid’s mechanism of action, which inhibits a highly conserved viral protease (9).

Current guidelines for Paxlovid indicate that persons who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19–associated outcomes should be considered for Paxlovid, with older age being a predominant risk factor (10). A study from Israel among persons with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 found comparable benefit from Paxlovid against severe outcomes among persons aged ≥65 years but did not find statistical evidence of protection among younger age groups (3). The current analysis adds to overall evidence of protection from Paxlovid by finding a statistically significant benefit among adults aged 18–64 years, specifically among adults aged 50–64 years with one or more underlying health condition and those aged 18–49 years with two or more underlying health conditions. Although ascertainment of deaths was limited to those with a documented death during the COVID-19 hospital admission, the proportion of persons with in-hospital death was also lower among persons who received Paxlovid (0.01%) than among those who did not (0.04%).

The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, receipt of a Paxlovid prescription is a proxy for use of Paxlovid. Paxlovid course completion could not be confirmed, which might bias the results toward the null. Second, dates of diagnosis or test positivity were used to estimate illness onset but might not reflect date of symptom onset, or the presence of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Third, possible inclusion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in the nonrecipient comparison group could bias estimates toward the null. Fourth, participants with mild illness might be overrepresented among Paxlovid prescription recipients compared with nonrecipients, given the higher proportion of telemedicine visits, potentially leading to overestimation of protection from Paxlovid; however, a sensitivity analysis restricted to in-person encounters showed similar overall results. Fifth, underlying health conditions and immunocompromise were approximated using ICD-10 codes or medical record fields and might not capture the exact prevalences of these conditions. Sixth, although available vaccination information is automatically collected at each encounter, incomplete information could have limited differences in estimates by vaccination status. Finally, hospitalizations might be incompletely ascertained in Cosmos; this limitation was mitigated by including only persons with previous face-to-face encounters, indicating higher likelihood of hospitalization within a participating health system.

This study demonstrates that Paxlovid provides protection against severe COVID-19–associated outcomes among persons for whom it is recommended, including those with vaccine-conferred immunity, and that it is underutilized among eligible persons with COVID-19. In this analysis, only 28% of eligible persons were prescribed Paxlovid. The ease of oral administration, short duration of therapy, and lower likelihood for resistance make Paxlovid a useful antiviral. Reduction in nonsevere outcomes, such as duration, number, and intensity of COVID-19 symptoms, requires further study. Paxlovid should be offered to eligible persons to protect against COVID-19 hospitalizations, irrespective of vaccination status, and especially among groups with the highest risk for severe outcomes, such as older adults and those with multiple underlying health conditions.","Corresponding author: Melisa M.

What is already known about this topic?

A high percentage of U.S. adults have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, attained through vaccination, infection, or both.

What is added by this report?

During August 2021–May 2022, 41.6% of a convenience sample of adults had both anti-spike antibodies (indicating previous infection or vaccination) and anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (indicating previous infection only); 43.7% of these persons were possibly asymptomatically infected. Prevalence of serologic patterns consistent with vaccination without infection was lower among adults who were younger, Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black or African American adults, and persons with less education.

What are the implications for public health practice?

CDC recommends that everyone stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination. These results can guide ongoing efforts that are needed to achieve equity in primary series vaccination and booster dose coverage. CDC COVID-19 surveillance systems monitor SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence to collect information about asymptomatic, undiagnosed, and unreported disease using national convenience samples of blood donor data from commercial laboratories (1,2). However, nonrandom sampling of data from these systems could affect prevalence estimates (1–3). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects SARS-CoV-2 serology data among a sample of the general U.S. civilian population (4). In addition, NHANES collects self-reported COVID-19 vaccination and disease history, and its statistical sampling design is not based on health care access or blood donation. Therefore, NHANES data can be used to better quantify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence and seropositivity attained through infection without vaccination. Preliminary NHANES 2021–2022 results indicated that 41.6% of adults aged ≥18 years had serology indicative of past infection and that 43.7% of these adults, including 57.1% of non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) adults, reported never having had COVID-19, possibly representing asymptomatic infection. In addition, 25.5% of adults whose serology indicated past infection reported never having received COVID-19 vaccination. Prevalences of seropositivity in the absence of vaccination were higher among younger adults and Black adults, reflecting the lower observed vaccination rates among these groups (5). These findings raise health equity concerns given the disparities observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. Results from NHANES 2021–2022 can guide ongoing efforts to achieve vaccine equity in COVID-19 primary vaccination series and booster dose coverage.*

The 2-year sample design of NHANES 2021–2022, includes 30 primary sampling units (usually a county) that are visited sequentially. In each 12-month data collection period, a nationally representative sample of 15 primary sampling units are visited. Preliminary data for adults aged ≥18 years from the first 10 primary sampling units (visited during periods of SARS-CoV-2 Delta [August–November 2021] and Omicron [December 2021–May 2022] variant predominance) (6) were analyzed as a convenience sample because data for all 15 primary sampling units were not yet available.† Analysis of preliminary unweighted NHANES data was conducted to examine SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in association with demographic characteristics and self-report of ever having had COVID-19 illness and having received ≥1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Sera were tested for anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies (which are produced in response to COVID-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both) using the Ortho VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Reagent Pack.§ Anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies, which are produced only in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, were assessed with the Total N Antibody Reagent Pack.¶ Seroprevalence was calculated by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin, and education in persons with combined anti-S–positive and anti-N–positive test results (infected, possibly vaccinated) and those with combined anti-S–positive and anti-N–negative test results (vaccinated, not infected). Among 1,581 participants with serology results, seven were excluded (including three with “don’t know” or “refused” responses for self-reported COVID-19 history and four with a combined serology result of anti-S–negative and anti-N–positive**) leaving an analytic sample of 1,574. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Final survey weights were unavailable at the time of this report because they are not calculated until the conclusion of the 2-year data collection cycle. Because NHANES uses a complex sampling design, simple random sampling assumptions for statistical testing are not appropriate. Therefore, statistical comparisons were not performed and references to differences among groups are based on observation only. The NHANES protocol was approved by the National Center for Health Statistics Ethics Review Board and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††

During August 2021–May 2022, a total of 91.5% of adults included in NHANES had SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibodies and 41.6% had anti-N antibodies. The percentage of adults with anti-S–positive, anti-N–positive serology (infected, possibly vaccinated) (Figure 1) was 41.6% overall and declined with age (59.7% among adults aged 18–29 years versus 30.2% among those aged ≥70 years); anti-S–positive, anti-N–positive prevalences were equivalent to anti-N–positive prevalences. The percentage of adults with this serologic profile also varied by race and Hispanic origin; 59.2% Hispanic, 45.9% Black, and 30.6% non-Hispanic White (White) adults were infected and possibly vaccinated. Percentages also declined with increasing education level, with 49.0% adults with less than high school education versus 37.5% of those with at least some college being infected and possibly vaccinated. In contrast, the percentage of adults with anti-S–positive, anti-N–negative results (vaccinated, not infected) (Figure 1) was 49.9% overall, increased with age (28.1% among adults aged 18–29 years versus 64.7% among those aged ≥70 years), was lower among Hispanic (35.3%) and Black adults (46.7%) and higher in White adults (58.9%), and lower in adults with less than high school education (42.5%) and higher in those with at least some college (55.4%).

Among 655 adult participants with anti-S–positive, anti-N–positive serology results (indicating infection), 43.7% reported that they had never had COVID-19 (Figure 2). This percentage was higher among Black adults (57.1%) and adults with less than high school education (57.8%) than among adults of other racial and ethnic groups and among those with higher educational attainment. Among anti-S-positive, anti-N-positive adults, 25.5% reported never having received any COVID-19 vaccination (Figure 2). Percentages of respondents who reported not having been vaccinated decreased with age (31.6% among adults aged 18–29 years versus 18.8% among adults aged ≥70 years). A higher percentage of Black adults (31.3%) and a lower percentage of Hispanic adults (21.4%) with serologic evidence of infection reported never having received COVID-19 vaccination.","Discussion

Preliminary analyses of unweighted NHANES data during August 2021–May 2022, found that 41.6% of adults had SARS-CoV-2 anti-N antibodies, consistent with previous infection. CDC’s nationwide commercial laboratory surveillance system estimated a higher anti-N seroprevalence (57.7%) among persons of all ages for the period January–February 2022 (2). This difference was not unexpected, given that the commercial laboratory estimate included sampling only after the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 Omicron wave (6) and included children, whose seroprevalence is higher than that of adults (2). However, patterns by age group and sex were similar between NHANES and commercial laboratory data sources, with declining anti-N antibody prevalence associated with increasing age and similar prevalences among males and females. Similar to the patterns in anti-N antibody seroprevalence by race and Hispanic origin observed in NHANES, CDC national blood donor surveillance data for persons aged ≥16 years through December 2021 also found higher anti-N seroprevalence in persons belonging to racial and ethnic minority groups (1,2). Antibody patterns in seropositive racial and ethnic minority adults were less likely to be consistent with vaccination and more likely to suggest past infection than those observed in seropositive White adults. These patterns are consistent with survey data indicating lower vaccination coverage and higher infection rates among Hispanic and Black adults than among White adults (5,7,8).

These findings confirm many patterns observed in other seroprevalence studies based on convenience samples that reflect increased vaccination rates among older persons and higher infection rates among younger persons (2). Currently, few U.S. data sources can provide data on antibody status and self-reported COVID-19 illness and vaccination. Preliminary NHANES data indicated that 43.7% of adults with serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported never having had COVID-19 and approximately one half of Black adults and those with lower educational attainment were possibly asymptomatically infected. Younger adults and Black adults with unidentified infections might have been more likely to lack access to testing and to have unknowingly exposed others, resulting in disparities in community transmission. In this way, undiagnosed infections could have amplified disparities in infection rates and outcomes (2,3). Furthermore, estimates of infection based on antigen testing results are likely underestimated. In addition, among anti-S–positive, anti-N–positive (infected and possibly vaccinated) adults, a higher percentage of younger and Black adults did not report any COVID-19 vaccination, suggesting that higher percentages of these groups acquired antibodies through infection rather than vaccination. Conversely, the antibody pattern consistent with vaccination without infection (anti-S–positive, anti-N–negative) was lower among Hispanic and Black adults and those with less than high school education.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, self-reported COVID-19 vaccination and infection history could be subject to social desirability bias. Second, to provide preliminary results, data from the first 10 primary sampling units were analyzed before completion of the 2-year NHANES data collection cycle. Because final survey weights were unavailable, no adjustment was made for nonresponse and unequal probability of selection by age. In addition, the unweighted sample is subject to bias and does not represent a particular population. For example, the population aged ≥60 years is overrepresented in this sample. Third, among the 10 primary sampling units included, those visited earlier in the survey cycle, during the predominance of the Delta variant, are combined with those visited later during the Omicron-predominant period. Thus, the seroprevalence estimates during these two variant periods are averaged over the period represented by NHANES data. Fourth, the observed seroprevalence in these 10 primary sampling units might differ from that in the primary sampling units that were not yet visited. Finally, seroprevalence might further underestimate the cumulative number of vaccinations and infections: some persons with infection or vaccination might remain seronegative (9), and infection after vaccination might result in lower anti-N titers (10).

CDC recommends that everyone remain up-to-date with COVID-19 vaccination. Consistent with findings from other seroprevalence studies, preliminary NHANES 2021–2022 results raise health equity concerns given the disparities observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. These results can guide ongoing efforts to achieve vaccine equity in COVID-19 primary vaccination series and booster dose coverage.","Corresponding author: Lara J.

What is already known about this topic?

Since 1978, M-M-R II has been the only measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) combination vaccine used in the United States. In June 2022, the Food and Drug Administration licensed an additional MMR vaccine, PRIORIX.

What is added by this report?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends PRIORIX as an additional option to prevent MMR according to existing vaccine recommendations and off-label uses.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Both vaccines are interchangeable for all indications for which MMR vaccination is recommended. Availability from multiple manufacturers safeguards U.S. vaccine supply. Vaccination is the main means for preventing measles, mumps, and rubella virus infections and their related complications (1,2). Achieving and maintaining high 2-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination coverage in the United States has led to elimination of endemic measles in 2000, rubella and congenital rubella syndrome in 2004, and a sharp decrease in mumps cases. However, measles and rubella remain endemic in many countries, leading to importations of cases and occasional local transmission within the United States (3). Reported U.S. mumps cases declined >99% from the prevaccine period (4); however, mumps is endemic worldwide, and since 2006, the number of mumps cases and mumps outbreaks has increased in the United States, with wider geographic spread since 2016 (4). Given the risk for importation of measles and rubella and the resurgence of mumps, maintaining high measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage is important. Since 1978, only one MMR vaccine, M-M-R II (Merck and Co., Inc.), has been available in the United States. On June 6, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration approved a second MMR vaccine, PRIORIX (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), for the prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella in persons aged ≥12 months. The three live attenuated viruses contained in PRIORIX are genetically similar or identical to the corresponding components in M-M-R II (Table) (5–7). On June 23, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) unanimously recommended PRIORIX as an option to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella according to the existing recommended schedules and for off-label uses (i.e., indications not included in the package insert)* (1,2). ACIP considered PRIORIX to be safe, immunogenic, and noninferior to M-M-R II. Both PRIORIX and M-M-R II are fully interchangeable for all indications for which MMR vaccination is recommended. This report contains ACIP recommendations specific to PRIORIX and supplements the existing ACIP recommendations for MMR use (1,2).

During January–June 2022, the ACIP Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine Work Group (Work Group) held monthly conference calls to review and assess the safety and immunogenicity of PRIORIX and to discuss implementation issues. The Work Group identified the following outcomes of interest for evaluation: 1) prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella; 2) short-term humoral immunity; 3) persistence of the humoral immune response; 4) reactogenicity of grade 3 or higher†; 5) vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs)§; and 6) additional adverse events of interest (i.e., rate of febrile seizures, aseptic meningitis, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP]). SAEs and reactogenicity of grade 3 or higher were evaluated only in studies conducted at or above the licensed U.S. potency for PRIORIX. Additional adverse events and immunogenicity were evaluated at any potency of PRIORIX.¶ The Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) framework was used to organize Work Group deliberations.**

Data on the outcomes of interest were summarized based on findings from a systematic review of the literature in PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane databases, and clinicaltrials.gov. Search terms for the literature review, study inclusion criteria, and supporting evidence are available online. All studies conducted with PRIORIX at the U.S. potency were included. For studies conducted at a potency different from that for the U.S.-licensed product, the evidence reviewed was restricted to the highest level of evidence: experimental design (i.e., randomized controlled clinical trials) or high-quality reviews (i.e., Cochrane reviews, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses).

The Work Group reviewed all included studies of PRIORIX to assess the safety and immunogenicity of PRIORIX and discussed implementation issues. Summaries of Work Group discussions were presented to ACIP on February 23, 2022 and on June 23, 2022. At the June 2022 meeting, a proposed recommendation was presented to the committee and, after a public comment period, was unanimously approved by the voting ACIP members. PRIORIX is recommended according to the existing recommended schedules and off-label uses as an option to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella.

Summary of Key Findings

SAEs related to administration of PRIORIX were assessed using findings from four randomized controlled clinical trials at the licensed U.S. potency of PRIORIX and one Cochrane review with PRIORIX at any potency (8–12). Four additional observational studies and one additional systematic review addressed additional adverse events of interest (i.e., rate of febrile seizures, aseptic meningitis, and ITP) (13–17). Outcomes for PRIORIX were compared with those for M-M-R II. In the four randomized controlled clinical trials at the U.S. potency of PRIORIX, safety profiles among 1,960 subjects receiving 1 or 2 doses of PRIORIX were compared with those among 933 subjects randomized to receive 1 or 2 doses of M-M-R II. The subjects ranged in age from 12 months to 12 years, with 90% aged 12–15 months. The frequency of vaccine-related SAEs was similar across the vaccine groups: 0.0%–0.2% among subjects receiving PRIORIX and 0.0%–0.3% among those receiving M-M-R II (8–11). No significant difference in frequency of vaccine-related SAEs was observed within each individual study; pooled estimates were not calculated.

The rate of febrile seizures is highest during the 6–11 days after vaccination for all MMR vaccines and is estimated to be 3.3–8.7 per 10,000 doses, based on two studies conducted in the United Kingdom, which included both PRIORIX and M-M-R II (13,15). In the clinical trials with PRIORIX of any potency that GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals conducted in the United States, after receipt of a first dose of MMR (PRIORIX or M-M-R II) at age 12–15 months, the rate of febrile seizures attributable to vaccination among 8,386 PRIORIX recipients was 9.5 per 10,000 (95% CI = 4.4–19.6) compared with 14.0 per 10,000 (95% CI = 5.2–34.8) among 3,561 M-M-R II recipients. These studies included coadministration of recommended age-appropriate vaccines, and all found the differences in rates of febrile seizures between the two vaccines to be nonsignificant (10,11,18,19). Similarly, the time course of fever was comparable for both vaccines across all studies, with most instances observed 5–12 days postvaccination (Remon Abu-Elyazeed, MD, PhD, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, personal communication, March 2022). No evidence of an association of aseptic meningitis with MMR vaccination was reported in the literature for vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn or Jeryl Lynn–derived mumps strains, which are included in both M-M-R II and PRIORIX for immunization against mumps (12,15,20).

ITP is associated with the receipt of live attenuated measles vaccines (12,14,16,17). In the four randomized controlled clinical trials at the U.S. potency of PRIORIX, one case of ITP was identified among 1,960 PRIORIX recipients and one case among 933 M-M-R II recipients. From a previous postmarketing study conducted in the United States, the rate of ITP after M-M-R II is estimated at 2.5 per 100,000 doses (14). However, strain- or vaccine formulation–specific data on ITP risk are sparse. Based on the clinical trials and the literature (12,14,16,17), the rates of ITP after vaccination were considered similar for PRIORIX and M-M-R II.

Short-term humoral immunity was assessed using data from 13 randomized controlled trials (8–11,18,19,21–27), four at the licensed U.S. potency of PRIORIX, and nine at a lower potency of PRIORIX used in other countries. Serologic response thresholds were achieved for all three antigens in all studies. Antibodies in all studies were more than 8.8-fold higher than the predefined seroresponse threshold for measles (200 mIU per mL; correlate of protection 120 mIU per mL) and more than 4.2-fold higher than the rubella correlate (10 IU per mL). Although an antibody correlate of protection has not been established for mumps, the anti-mumps antibody level was ≥3.3-fold higher than the mumps seroconversion threshold (10 IU per mL). The four studies conducted with PRIORIX at the U.S. potency found no significant difference in anti-measles, anti-mumps, or anti-rubella geometric mean concentrations (GMC) after the first dose between PRIORIX and M-M-R II recipients. Among the nine studies at a lower PRIORIX potency, eight showed no statistically significant difference between anti-measles or anti-rubella GMC levels, and seven showed no statistically significant difference between anti-mumps GMC levels. One study reported on persistence of the humoral immune response (2 years after vaccination) and found no difference between vaccines (8). None of the four studies that reported on GMC after a second dose noted a significant difference for any antigen at any potency after a second dose between PRIORIX or M-M-R II recipients (9,18,21,28).

Additional data reviewed within the EtR framework included findings from a focus group conducted with state immunization managers and a survey of pediatric and general practitioners regarding the feasibility for use and acceptability of PRIORIX. Both the focus group and the survey findings supported the interchangeability of M-M-R II and PRIORIX and the benefit of having a second MMR vaccine option available.

Rationale for Recommendation

Given the similarities in potency (Table) and vaccine components, and evidence for similar safety and immunogenicity, as well as stakeholder support, PRIORIX and M-M-R II are considered fully interchangeable, including for all off-label recommended uses. Either vaccine may be administered in any situation in which an MMR virus–containing vaccine is indicated. Two interchangeable vaccines from different manufacturers will help safeguard vaccine supply in the United States to maintain measles and rubella elimination and mitigate mumps cases and outbreaks.

ACIP Recommendation

PRIORIX is recommended according to the existing MMR recommended schedules and off-label uses (1,2) as an option to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella.

Clinical Guidance

PRIORIX is supplied as a single-dose vial of lyophilized antigen to be reconstituted with the accompanying prefilled syringe of sterile water diluent. A single dose after reconstitution is approximately 0.5 mL. PRIORIX is formulated without preservatives and is administered as subcutaneous injection (the same as M-M-R II) (5,29).

PRIORIX may be used according to the existing MMR recommendations for both on- and off-label use for prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella†† (1,2). For routine vaccination, 2 doses are recommended, the first at age 12–15 months, and the second at age 4–6 years. For catch-up vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents, 2 doses should be administered ≥4 weeks apart. Before international travel, infants aged 6–11 months should receive a single dose. Travelers aged ≥12 months who have not received 2 doses of MMR should receive 2 doses separated by ≥28 days.

During a measles outbreak, infants aged 6–11 months should receive a single dose of MMR. For measles postexposure prophylaxis in unvaccinated persons, 1 dose of MMR should be administered within 72 hours of exposure to a person with infectious measles, and the 2-dose series (i.e., the second of 2 MMR doses) should be completed ≥28 days later. During mumps outbreaks, a third dose of MMR is recommended for persons identified by public health authorities as being part of a group or population at increased risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak.

Interchangeability

PRIORIX and M-M-R II are fully interchangeable. ACIP General Best Practices states a preference that doses of vaccine in a series come from the same manufacturer; however, vaccination should not be deferred when the manufacturer of the previously administered vaccine is unknown or when the vaccine from the same manufacturer is unavailable (30). Studies have shown that PRIORIX is safe and immunogenic when administered as a second dose after M-M-R II (10,21).

Timing of Vaccination and Coadministration with Other Vaccines

PRIORIX can be administered concomitantly, at different anatomic sites, with other routine childhood vaccines. Concomitant administration of PRIORIX with other live and nonlive vaccines§§ has been studied; results indicated no safety concerns or evidence for interference in the immune response to either (8,10,11,18,19,21,28). Additional live virus vaccines not administered on the same day should be separated by ≥4 weeks (30).

Precautions and Contraindications

Before administering PRIORIX, health care providers should consult the package insert for precautions, warnings, and contraindications (5,29). Contraindications for PRIORIX are the same as those for M-M-R II. PRIORIX should not be administered to persons with a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine or after a previous dose of any measles, mumps, and rubella virus–containing vaccine (unlike M-M-R II, PRIORIX does not contain gelatin); persons with severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency; or women who are pregnant. Pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month after receipt of MMR. Additional information on warnings and precautions can be found in the package insert and previous vaccine recommendations (1,5,29).

Reporting of Vaccine Adverse Events

Adverse events following administration of any vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, or by mail. Additional information about VAERS is available by telephone (1-800-822-7967) or online (https://vaers.hhs.gov). Any future revisions to this ACIP recommendation will be dictated by reported adverse events and new research evidence.",,"Corresponding author: Elisabeth Krow-Lucal, yxn9@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Krow-Lucal E, Marin M, Shepersky L, Bahta L, Loehr J, Dooling K.

Progress toward measles elimination experienced setbacks in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

What is added by this report?

During 2000–2021, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 56 million deaths worldwide. In 2021, only 81% of children received their first dose of measles containing vaccine (MCV), the lowest coverage reported since 2008, leaving 25 million children vulnerable to measles. Measles surveillance continues to be suboptimal, and large and disruptive outbreaks were reported in 22 countries.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Reaching all children with 2 doses of MCV and strengthening measles surveillance is critical to close immunity gaps, prevent outbreaks, and recover progress lost during the pandemic.

All six World Health Organization (WHO) regions have committed to eliminating measles.* The Immunization Agenda 2021–2030 (IA2030)† aims to achieve the regional targets as a core indicator of impact and positions measles as the tracer of a health system’s ability to deliver essential childhood vaccines. IA2030 highlights the importance of ensuring rigorous measles surveillance systems to document immunity gaps and achieve 95% coverage with 2 timely doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) among children. This report describes progress toward measles elimination during 2000–2021 and updates a previous report (1). During 2000–2021, estimated global coverage with a first MCV dose (MCV1) increased from 72% to a peak of 86% in 2019, but decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic to 83% in 2020 and to 81% in 2021, the lowest MCV1 coverage recorded since 2008. All countries conducted measles surveillance, but only 47 (35%) of 135 countries reporting discarded cases§ achieved the sensitivity indicator target of two or more discarded cases per 100,000 population in 2021, indicating surveillance system underperformance in certain countries. Annual reported measles incidence decreased 88% during 2000–2016, from 145 to 18 cases per 1 million population, then rebounded to 120 in 2019 during a global resurgence (2), before declining to 21 in 2020 and to 17 in 2021. Large and disruptive outbreaks were reported in 22 countries. During 2000–2021, the annual number of estimated measles deaths decreased 83%, from 761,000 to 128,000; an estimated 56 million measles deaths were averted by vaccination. To regain progress and achieve regional measles elimination targets during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating targeted efforts is necessary to reach all children with 2 MCV doses while implementing robust surveillance and identifying and closing immunity gaps to prevent cases and outbreaks.


Immunization Activities
WHO and UNICEF use data from 1) administrative coverage (calculated by dividing the number of vaccine doses administered by the estimated target population reported annually), 2) country estimates,¶ and 3) vaccination coverage surveys to estimate MCV1 and second dose MCV (MCV2) coverage through routine immunization services (i.e., not mass campaigns).** During 2000–2010, estimated MCV1 coverage increased worldwide from 72% to 84%. However, coverage stagnated at 84% to 86% during 2010–2019, decreased to 83% in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and further declined to 81% in 2021. Although regional variation exists, all six WHO regions reported a decline in MCV1 coverage since 2019, with only the European Region plateauing from 2020 to 2021 (Table 1).

Among 194 WHO member states, 91 (47%) achieved ≥90% MCV1 coverage in 2021; however, among these countries, only 24 (26%) reported MCV1 coverage of ≥80% in all districts. In 2021, 24.7 million infants did not receive MCV1 through routine immunization services, an increase of 2.4 million (11%) from 2020. The 10 countries with the highest number of infants who did not receive MCV1 were Nigeria (3.1 million), India (2.5 million), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1.7 million), Ethiopia (1.7 million), Indonesia (1.2 million), Pakistan (1.2 million), Philippines (1.0 million), Angola (0.8 million), Brazil (0.7 million), and Tanzania (0.5 million). These countries accounted for 59% of all children who did not receive MCV1. Estimated MCV2 coverage quadrupled from 17% in 2000 to 72% in 2020, then declined slightly, to 71% in 2021. The number of countries offering MCV2 increased by 92%, from 95 (50%) in 2000 to 182 (94%) in 2021. Three countries (Comoros, Côte d’Ivoire, and Equatorial Guinea) introduced MCV2 in 2021.††

Approximately 150 million persons received MCV during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs)§§ in 18 countries in 2021. An additional 4 million persons received MCV during measles outbreak response activities. As of December 2021, 25 MCV campaigns that had been postponed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic had been conducted; however, 18 MCV campaigns planned since March 2020 had still not been conducted, which resulted in an estimated 61 million postponed or missed MCV doses.


Surveillance Performance and Reported Measles Incidence
WHO’s Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN) supports countries in providing standardized quality-controlled laboratory testing for measles and rubella. Among the 135 (70%) countries that reported discarded cases, 47 (35%) achieved the sensitivity indicator target of two or more discarded cases per 100,000 population in 2021, compared with 45 (31%) of 143 countries reporting in 2020. In 2021, GMRLN laboratories received 122,735 specimens for measles testing compared with 122,116 specimens in 2020.

Countries report the number of incident measles cases to WHO and UNICEF annually, using the Joint Reporting Form.¶¶ During 2000–2016, the number of reported measles cases decreased by 84%, from 853,479 to 132,490. Reported measles cases peaked at 873,022 in 2019, then declined to 159,073 in 2020, and 123,981 in 2021. From 2000 to 2016, annual measles incidence decreased 88%, from 145 cases per 1 million population to 18; measles incidence then increased to 120 cases per million in 2019 and decreased 82% to 21 in 2020 and 22% to 17 in 2021. In 2021, 22 countries in two WHO regions were affected by large and disruptive outbreaks***; 18 (82%) outbreaks occurred in countries in the African Region and four (18%) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/122049).

Genotypes detected from measles cases††† were reported by 27 (33%) of the 82 countries reporting at least one measles case in 2021, compared with 45 (39%) of 115 countries reporting at least one measles case in 2020. The number of genotypes detected decreased from 13 in 2002 to six in 2014, three in 2020, and two in 2021. A total of 1,615 sequences were reported in 2020; among 648 reported sequences in 2021, 221 (34%) were D8 and 426 (66%) were B3.


Measles Case and Mortality Estimates
A previously described model (3) for estimating measles cases and deaths was updated with 2021 measles data and United Nations 2000–2021 population estimates.§§§ Data on case fatality from an updated systematic review and a suite of covariates with known relationships to case fatality were used in a Bayesian meta-regression modeling framework to produce estimates of measles case fatality ratios¶¶¶ (4). The updated estimates reflect heterogeneity among countries, years, and ages. On the basis of the revised model and 2021 data, the estimated number of measles cases decreased 72%, from 34,013,000 in 2000 to 9,484,000 in 2021; estimated annual measles deaths decreased 83%, from 761,000 to 128,000 (Table 2). However, the estimated numbers of both cases and deaths were higher in 2021 compared with those in 2020. During 2000–2021, compared with no measles vaccination, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 56 million deaths globally (Figure).


Regional Verification of Measles Elimination
By the end of 2021, 76 (39%) countries had been verified by independent regional commissions as having achieved or maintained measles elimination status. No WHO region had achieved and sustained elimination, and no African Region country has yet been verified to have eliminated measles. WHO’s Region of the Americas achieved verification of measles elimination in 2016; however, endemic measles transmission was reestablished in Venezuela (2016) and Brazil (2018). Since 2016, endemic transmission has been reestablished in eight other countries (Albania, Cambodia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan) that had previously achieved verification of measles elimination.","All WHO regions remain committed to measles elimination; however, no region has achieved and sustained elimination targets. Drops in MCV1 coverage and declines in surveillance performance that started or continued during the COVID-19 pandemic persisted in 2021 (5–7). Among regions, the Southeast Asia Region faced the largest decrease in MCV1 coverage (from 94% to 86%) between 2019 and 2021, and only the European Region maintained MCV1 coverage from 2020 to 2021. None of the WHO regions have recovered MCV1 or MCV2 coverage levels from 2019, which were still below the 95% coverage needed to achieve and sustain measles elimination (8). 

SIAs represent an opportunity to reach children with missing MCV doses from the routine immunization program and close immunity gaps.**** In 2021, the implementation of 25 campaigns that had been delayed because of COVID-19 indicates some pandemic recovery; however, 18 pending SIAs that had not yet been conducted as of December 2021 present a risk for measles outbreaks. 

The observed decrease in measles incidence in 2020 and 2021 could reflect actual changes related to increased immunity after a 2017–2019 global resurgence of measles, reduced viral transmission associated with COVID-19 mitigation measures, limited detection resulting from surveillance system underperformance, or a combination of multiple factors (1,2,9). Sensitivity of measles surveillance remained low in 2021, with continued low numbers of specimens received for laboratory testing and few countries achieving the surveillance sensitivity indicator. Sustained declines in surveillance not only affect the timely detection of cases and outbreaks but also undermine a program’s ability to use measles as a tracer to highlight gaps in the overall immunization system. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, not all countries report complete, or any, data for SIAs and outbreak response activities; therefore, the numbers on these activities provided in this report could be underestimated. Second, the measles estimation model was updated this year, which limits comparability with estimates from previous years. Finally, the number of specimens submitted for genotyping represents a fraction of measles cases; hence, data presented in this report might not reflect the actual global distribution of genotypes. 

Declining routine MCV coverage and delays in SIAs in 2021 left millions of children with zero or only 1 dose of MCV. In the absence of a high-performing surveillance system to promptly detect cases, a growing population of susceptible children is at risk for measles disease and outbreaks. In alignment with IA2030, the Measles and Rubella Strategic Framework 2021–2030†††† outlines strategies for countries to build robust, case-based surveillance for measles to detect immunity gaps and outbreaks, identify root causes of undervaccination, and develop targeted solutions, including catch-up immunization for those who missed routine immunization doses during the pandemic, to reach all children with 2 doses of MCV. Accelerating these measures will help regain historical progress toward regional measles elimination.","Corresponding author: Anna A.

Youth use of tobacco products in any form is unsafe, and nearly all tobacco use begins during youth and young adulthood (2). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC analyzed data from the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) to estimate current (past 30-day) use of eight tobacco products among U.S. middle (grades 6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students. In 2022, approximately 11.3% of all students (representing 3.08 million persons) reported currently using any tobacco product, including 16.5% of high school and 4.5% of middle school students (2.51 million and 530,000 persons, respectively). Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly used tobacco product among high school (14.1%; 2.14 million) and middle school (3.3%; 380,000) students. Approximately 3.7% of all students (representing 1 million persons) reported currently smoking any combustible tobacco product. Current use of any tobacco product was higher among certain population groups, including 13.5% of non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN)† students; 16.0% of students identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB); 16.6% of students identifying as transgender; 18.3% of students reporting severe psychological distress; 12.5% of students with low family affluence; and 27.2% of students with low academic achievement. Implementation of comprehensive evidence-based tobacco control strategies, combined with FDA regulation, is important for preventing and reducing youth tobacco product use (1,2).

NYTS is a cross-sectional, voluntary, school-based, self-administered survey of U.S. middle and high school students. A stratified, three-stage cluster sampling procedure generated a nationally representative sample of U.S. students attending public and private schools in grades 6–12. In 2022, the survey was administered during January 18–May 31, 2022. The 2022 NYTS was conducted using an online survey, with nearly all (99.3%) students completing it on a school campus. In total, 28,291 students (student participation rate = 76.1%) from 341 schools (school participation rate = 59.4%) participated, yielding an overall response rate of 45.2%. Because of changes in methodology, including differences in survey administration and data collection procedures, the ability to compare estimates from 2022 with those from previous NYTS waves is limited; differences between estimates might result from changes in methodology, actual behavior, or both.§ Detailed information about NYTS is available online.¶

Weighted prevalence estimates and population totals** of current use of eight tobacco products (e-cigarettes, cigars, cigarettes, smokeless tobacco,†† hookahs, nicotine pouches,§§ heated tobacco products, and pipe tobacco) and three composite measures (use of any tobacco product,¶¶ any combustible tobacco product,*** and multiple tobacco products†††) were reported among all students and by school level; current use was defined as use on ≥1 day during the past 30 days. In addition, estimates of current use of any tobacco product were reported by selected demographic characteristics§§§ and indicators of social determinants of health.¶¶¶ Estimates with a relative SE of >30% or an unweighted denominator of <50 were suppressed. Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.4; RTI International). The 2022 NYTS was approved by the Office of Management and Budget, the contracted data collectors’ institutional review board (IRB), and CDC’s IRB.****

In 2022, among middle and high school students, 24.8% reported ever having used any tobacco product (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/122048), and 11.3% reported current use of any tobacco product (Table 1). Overall, current use of any tobacco product was reported by 12.3% of female, 10.3% of male, 13.5% of AI/AN, 13.0% of non-Hispanic multiracial (multiracial), 12.4% of non-Hispanic White (White), 11.5% of non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), 11.1% of Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), and 3.1% of non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) students. Current use of any combustible tobacco product was reported by 5.7% of Black, 4.7% of multiracial, 4.6% of AI/AN, 3.9% of Hispanic, and 3.4% of White students. Notably, current use of any combustible tobacco product was highest among Black students, specifically for cigar (3.3%) and hookah (2.3%) use. Estimates among non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) students, overall and by school level, were statistically unreliable for all current use measures and are not reported.

Tobacco use prevalence varied by certain demographic characteristics and indicators of social determinants of health. By sexual identity, current use of any tobacco product was 16.0% among middle and high school students identifying as LGB, 9.7% among those identifying as heterosexual, and 7.1% among those who were not sure. In addition, current use of any tobacco product was reported by 16.6% of students identifying as transgender, 14.5% of those who were not sure, and 10.2% of those identifying as not transgender (Table 2). Prevalence of current tobacco product use ranged from 7.2% among students reporting no psychological distress to 18.3% among those reporting severe distress.†††† Current use of any tobacco product was reported by 12.5% of students whose families were categorized as having low affluence,§§§§ and by 9.6% of those with medium or high family affluence. Current tobacco product use was inversely related to self-reported grades in school, ranging from 6.6% among those reporting “mostly As” to 27.2% among those reporting “mostly Fs.” Current tobacco product use was higher among students who spoke English in the home (11.1%) compared with those who spoke another language at home (8.5%).

Among high school students, 16.5% reported current use of any tobacco product, 5.2% (31.5% of current users of any tobacco product) reported current use of any combustible tobacco product, and 5.0% (30.3% of any tobacco product users) reported current use of multiple tobacco products. E-cigarettes were the product type most commonly used (14.1%), followed by cigars (2.8%), cigarettes (2.0%), smokeless tobacco (1.6%), hookahs (1.5%), nicotine pouches (1.4%), heated tobacco products (1.1%), and pipe tobacco (0.7%).

Among middle school students, 4.5% reported current use of any tobacco product, 1.6% (35.6% of current users of any tobacco product) reported current use of any combustible tobacco product, and 1.5% (33.3% of any tobacco product users) reported current use of multiple tobacco products. By product type, e-cigarettes were most commonly used (3.3%), followed by cigarettes (1.0%), smokeless tobacco and heated tobacco products (both 0.7%), cigars (0.6%), hookahs and nicotine pouches (both 0.5%), and pipe tobacco (0.3%).","An estimated 3.08 million U.S. middle and high school students reported current use of any tobacco product in 2022, representing approximately one in six high school students and one in 22 middle school students. Among all students who currently used any tobacco product, 31.0% reported using multiple tobacco products during the past 30 days. Multiple tobacco product use among youths is particularly concerning because it is associated with nicotine dependence, which increases the likelihood of sustained tobacco use in adulthood (1–3). 

Similar to the previous year (4), indicators of social determinants of health were assessed in relation to tobacco product use, and in 2022, estimates for Asian, AI/AN, NH/OPI, and multiracial population groups were provided for the first time, allowing measurement of disparities affecting these groups. These findings suggested disparities in current tobacco product use among U.S. youths. Whereas AI/AN students reported the highest prevalence of current use of any tobacco product, current use of any combustible tobacco product, specifically cigar and hookah use, was highest among Black students. In addition, current use of any tobacco product was higher among those students identifying as LGB or transgender, those reporting severe psychological distress, those with low family affluence, and those with low academic achievement. 

Cigarette smoking among U.S. youths has been steadily declining during the past 2 decades (1,2). Although the ability to compare results between 2022 and previous survey waves is limited because of methodological changes, approximately 3.7% of middle and high school students reported current use of any combustible tobacco product in 2022. Efforts are ongoing at the national, state, and local levels, such as enforcing the federal minimum age of sale of 21 years for all tobacco product types (5) and restricting the sale of flavored tobacco products in some states and communities.¶¶¶¶ In addition, efforts have been made to raise the price of tobacco products, prohibit public indoor use of tobacco products, and warn about the dangers of tobacco product use through media campaigns and other educational interventions (6). Furthermore, factors related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have possibly affected youth access to tobacco products and tobacco use (7). 

The 2022 NYTS findings suggest ongoing disparities in tobacco product use, which, to a certain extent, might be attributed to higher volume of exposure to tobacco promotion and advertising and higher tobacco retail outlet density in racial and ethnic minority communities among other systemic environmental factors (2). Concerted efforts by parents, schools, and those who work with youths are necessary to reduce tobacco-related disparities by helping youths recognize and avoid the dangers of tobacco use. Furthermore, combined with regulation by FDA, efforts to address social and structural determinants of health disparities are warranted for advancing tobacco-related health equity and reducing and preventing all forms of tobacco product use among U.S. youths (1,2). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, data were self-reported and cross-sectional in nature; they might be subject to recall and response bias, and no causal inferences can be drawn. Second, data were collected only from middle and high school students who attended public or private schools; findings might not be generalizable to youths who are home-schooled, have dropped out of school, are in detention centers, or are enrolled in alternative schools. However, data from the Current Population Survey indicate that approximately 96% of U.S. youths aged 10–17 years were enrolled in a traditional school in 2020 (8). Third, the student participation rate in 2022 was lower than expected. However, weighting adjustments for nonresponse were applied to produce national weighted estimates.***** Fourth, because of small sample sizes, many estimates for racial and ethnic population groups were not reliable, especially for less prevalent tobacco products and among the NH/OPI population. Finally, the current definition of AI/AN excludes students indicating both AI/AN and another race and ethnicity, further reducing the sample size and statistical power for the AI/AN group assessed in these data. 

Youth use of tobacco products in any form is unsafe. In 2022, nearly one in nine U.S. middle and high school students, or approximately 3.08 million youths overall, reported current use of any tobacco product. Continued surveillance efforts of all tobacco product types, including novel products, and sustained implementation of population-based tobacco control strategies, combined with regulation by FDA, are warranted to prevent and reduce youth tobacco product use.","Corresponding author: Eunice Park-Lee, Eunice.Park-Lee@fda.hhs.gov, 301-837-7342.","Suggested citation for this article: Park-Lee E, Ren C, Cooper M, Cornelius M, Jamal A, Cullen KA.

What is already known about this topic?

Although COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, administrative data reported to CDC indicate that COVID-19 vaccination coverage among children aged <5 years is low.

What is added by this report?

Four percent of children aged 6 months–4 years had received ≥1 doses of COVID-19 vaccine based on interviews conducted during July 2022; 59% were unvaccinated, but the parent was open to vaccinating their child; and 37% were unvaccinated and the parent was reluctant to vaccinate. Among parents open to vaccination, 25% reported receiving a provider recommendation, and 57% were confident of the vaccine’s safety; confidence of vaccine safety varied by race or ethnicity and household income.

What are the implications for public health?

Health care provider recommendations and assurances of COVID-19 vaccine safety by trusted persons could increase vaccination coverage among young children.

COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for infants and young children, and on June 18, 2022, CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccination for infants and children (children) aged 6 months–4 years (1,2). As of November 9, 2022, based on administrative data reported to CDC,* 5.9% of children aged <2 years and 8.8% of children aged 2–4 years had received ≥1 dose. To better understand reasons for low coverage among children aged <5 years, CDC analyzed data from 4,496 National Immunization Survey-Child COVID Module (NIS-CCM) interviews conducted during July 1–29, 2022, to examine variation in receipt of ≥1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine and parental intent to vaccinate children aged 6 months–4 years by sociodemographic characteristics and by parental beliefs about COVID-19; type of vaccination place was also reported. Among children aged 6 months–4 years, 3.5% were vaccinated; 59.3% were unvaccinated, but the parent was open to vaccination; and 37.2% were unvaccinated, and the parent was reluctant to vaccinate their child. Openness to vaccination was higher among parents of Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (66.2%), non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (61.1%), and non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) (83.1%) children than among parents of non-Hispanic White (White) (52.9%) children and lower among parents of children in rural areas (45.8%) than among parents of children in urban areas (64.1%). Parental confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety and receipt of a provider recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination were lower among unvaccinated than vaccinated children. COVID-19 vaccine recommendations from a health care provider, along with dissemination of information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccine by trusted persons, could increase vaccination coverage among young children.

NIS-CCM† is an ongoing, national random-digit–dialed mobile telephone survey of households that include children and adolescents aged 6 months–17 years (3,4). The survey respondent was a parent or guardian (parent) who indicated they were knowledgeable about the child’s vaccination history. COVID-19 vaccination status was based on the parent’s response to the question, “Has [child] received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine?” Among parents of unvaccinated children, parental intent was measured by asking, “How likely are you to get [child] a COVID-19 vaccine? Would you say you would definitely get a vaccine for [child], probably get a vaccine, probably not get a vaccine, definitely not get a vaccine, or are not sure?” Responses were grouped as follows: 1) child vaccinated with ≥1 dose; 2) child unvaccinated and parent open to vaccination, defined as parents of unvaccinated children reporting they definitely or probably would get the child vaccinated or were unsure; and 3) child unvaccinated and parent reluctant to vaccinate, defined as parents of unvaccinated children reporting they definitely or probably would not get the child vaccinated. Parents of vaccinated children also reported the type of place§ where the child was vaccinated. Variables¶ describing potential drivers of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were derived from the Behavioral and Social Drivers of Vaccination (BeSD) framework (5).

Data from 4,496 interviews conducted during July 1–29, 2022, were analyzed; estimating parental intent to vaccinate their child began during December 2021.** The cumulative NIS-CCM response rate was 20.4%. Weighted proportions with 95% CIs were estimated, accounting for the complex survey design and weights, using SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; RTI International) and SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc.).†† T-tests for proportions were used to test for differences, with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§


National COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage, Parental Intent, and Place of Vaccination
During the period preceding authorization of the vaccine for children aged 6 months–4 years, the percentage of children whose parent reported they definitely would get their child vaccinated decreased from 41.3% in December 2021 to 33.5% in May 2022 (Figure 1). By mid-July 2022, 3.5% of children were reported to have received ≥1 dose, 59.3% were unvaccinated and the parent reported being open to vaccination (22.6% definitely would, 16.4% probably would, and 20.3% were unsure), and 37.2% were unvaccinated and the parent was reluctant to vaccinate (13.0% probably would not and 24.3% definitely would not) (Figure 1). The distribution of places where vaccination was received was 78.5% in a medical setting (40.0% doctor’s office, 21.1% clinic or health center, 11.4% hospital, 5.0% health department, and 1.0% other medical place); 15.0% at a pharmacy or drug store; 4.4% at a mass vaccination place; 1.8% at another nonmedical place; and 0.3% at a school.

Vaccination Coverage and Parental Intent, by Selected Characteristics
A higher percentage of White children (4.5%) had received COVID-19 vaccination during the first month of recommendation than Hispanic (2.5%) and Black children (1.0%) (Table). However, higher percentages of Asian (83.1%), Black (61.1%), and Hispanic (66.2%) children had parents reporting they were open to vaccination compared with White children (52.9%). A higher percentage of children in households with income >$75,000 per year and with higher maternal educational attainment had received ≥1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine versus children from lower-income households and those whose mothers had lower educational attainment. A lower percentage of children living in rural areas had been vaccinated (1.6%) compared with those living in urban areas (4.2%), and a lower percentage of children living in rural areas (45.8%) had parents reporting they were open to getting their child vaccinated compared with those living in urban areas (64.1%). The percentage of children who received COVID-19 vaccination and the percentage of children with parents reporting they were reluctant to get their child vaccinated varied by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region (range = 1.6%–7.3% and 26.2%–48.4%), respectively.


Attitudes and Social Factors
A high percentage (87.3%) of unvaccinated children whose parent was open to vaccination had a parent reporting that getting a COVID-19 vaccine for their child was somewhat or very important; however, a lower percentage had parents perceive the vaccine as safe than among vaccinated children (57.1% versus 91.6%), and a lower percentage reported having received a provider recommendation for vaccination (24.6% versus 62.7%) (Figure 2). Among unvaccinated children whose parent was open to vaccination, a lower percentage of Hispanic (47.9%) and Black (47.3%) children’s parents perceived the vaccine as safe compared with White children (66.6%), and a lower percentage of children in households below the poverty level (37.5%) had parents perceiving the vaccine as safe compared with children in households with income >$75,000 per year (69.6%) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/122000). Parents reluctant to vaccinate their child were less likely to report being concerned about the child getting COVID-19 than parents of vaccinated children (20.8% versus 59.8%), consider vaccination to be important (24.3% versus 97.1%), consider COVID-19 vaccine to be safe (7.1% versus 91.6%), and report a provider recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination (17.0% versus 62.7%) (Figure 2).","This analysis indicates that 3.5% of children aged 6 months–4 years had received a COVID-19 vaccination during the first month after the vaccine was recommended. In comparison, vaccination coverage among children aged 5–11 years was 20.7% during the first month after the recommendation (6). This report also identified early indications of racial and ethnic and urban versus rural differences in coverage previously observed for children in other age groups during the first months after the recommendations (7). 

Approximately 5 months have elapsed since COVID-19 vaccination of children aged 6 months–4 years was recommended; this report indicates that a large proportion of children have parents who intend to have them vaccinated, yet these parents have concerns about vaccine safety. Confidence in vaccine safety varied by race or ethnicity and household income. Trusted persons (e.g., a child’s pediatrician) providing accurate information to parents about vaccine safety, especially to parents of Hispanic or Black children or parents in lower-income households, might encourage these parents to have their child vaccinated. 

This report indicates that approximately three fourths of vaccinated children aged 6 months–4 years received their COVID-19 vaccine at a medical place. This is a larger proportion than that for children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, 38% of whom were vaccinated at medical places and 45% at pharmacies (8). The larger role of the medical home,¶¶ and medical places in general, in the delivery of vaccines to young children underscores the need for provider recommendation for vaccination. Studies have determined the importance of strong provider recommendations for vaccination (9), yet only approximately one fourth of unvaccinated children with parents open to vaccination were reported to have received a provider recommendation. A majority of parents open to vaccination consider the vaccine to be important; the addition of a provider recommendation that includes accurate information about vaccine safety could be critical to these parents deciding to have their children vaccinated. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the response rate was 20%. Survey weights were calibrated to COVID-19 vaccine administration data to mitigate possible bias from incomplete sample frame, nonresponse, and misclassification of vaccination status; however, bias in estimates might remain after weighting. Second, vaccination status and intent to vaccinate were parent-reported and subject to recall and social desirability biases. 

These findings indicate that a large proportion of unvaccinated children have parents who are open to vaccination; however, many parents had concerns about vaccine safety and had not received a provider recommendation. A strong vaccination recommendation from a trusted health care provider, along with accurate information about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination, could potentially increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage among young children.","Corresponding author: Tammy A.

During June–July 2022, many U.S. counties experienced high COVID-19 transmission levels.

What is added by this report?

One half of adults surveyed during June–July 2022 who had recently received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result in metropolitan Detroit, Michigan and DuPage County, Illinois perceived local COVID-19 transmission when surveyed to be low or moderate, despite documented sustained high transmission. Higher perceived local COVID-19 transmission was associated with more use of preventive behaviors, overall and in response to high local COVID-19 transmission.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Continued monitoring of public perceptions of local COVID-19 levels, and further understanding their impact on use of preventive behaviors, can guide pandemic-related communication strategies and policymaking.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, use of preventive behaviors was associated with perceived risk for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection (1,2). Over time, perceived risk has declined along with waning COVID-19–related media coverage (3,4). The extent to which communities continue to be aware of local COVID-19 transmission levels and are implementing recommended preventive behaviors is unknown. During June 1–July 31, 2022, health departments in DuPage County, Illinois and metropolitan Detroit, Michigan surveyed a combined total of 4,934 adults who had received a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 during the preceding 3 weeks. The association between awareness of local COVID-19 transmission and use of preventive behaviors and practices was assessed, both in response to perceived local COVID-19 transmission levels and specifically during the 2 weeks preceding SARS-CoV-2 testing. Both areas had experienced sustained high COVID-19 transmission during the study interval as categorized by CDC COVID-19 transmission levels.* Overall, 702 (14%) respondents perceived local COVID-19 transmission levels as high, 987 (20%) as substantial, 1,902 (39%) as moderate, and 581 (12%) as low; 789 (16%) reported they did not know. Adjusting for geographic area, age, gender identity, and combined race and ethnicity, respondents who perceived local COVID-19 transmission levels as high were more likely to report having made behavioral changes because of the level of COVID-19 transmission in their area, including wearing a mask in public, limiting travel, and avoiding crowded places or events. Continued monitoring of public perceptions of local COVID-19 levels and developing a better understanding of their influence on the use of preventive behaviors can guide COVID-19 communication strategies and policy making during and beyond the pandemic.

During June 1–July 31, 2022, adults aged ≥18 years who had received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results within the preceding 3 weeks who were reported to six participating health departments† were invited via SMS text messages to complete anonymous, English-language Internet-based questionnaires as part of the COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative.§ The number of surveys sent to eligible potential respondents during this interval is not known. Respondents self-reported demographic information and the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses they had received. Respondents also 1) characterized levels of local COVID-19 transmission when surveyed as high, substantial, moderate, low, or unknown¶; 2) classified their level of concern about new variants of SARS-CoV-2; 3) reported frequency of having used preventive behaviors, including wearing a mask in public (and mask type worn), limiting travel, and avoiding crowded places or events, during the 2 weeks preceding SARS-CoV-2 testing**; and 4) reported changes in these preventive behaviors in response to perceived levels of local COVID-19 transmission.††

This analysis reviewed survey responses from participating health departments with 1,000 or more respondents during the study interval, which included the metropolitan area of Detroit, Michigan (including Lapeer, Livingston, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne counties) and DuPage County, Illinois. During June 1–July 31, 2022, a total of 5,575 persons from the Detroit metropolitan area, who had received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result opened the survey, 4,274 (76.7%) of whom completed the survey; 3,934 (92.0%) of these respondents provided information for all of the variables included in this analysis (except for general health status) and were included in the analytic sample.§§ Also during this interval, 1,546 persons from DuPage County, Illinois who had received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result opened the survey; 1,207 (78.1%) completed the survey and 1,000 (83.0%) of these respondents provided information for all of the variables included in this analysis and were added to the analytic sample. Pearson’s chi-square tests were used to compare perceived local COVID-19 transmission across demographic groups, by number of vaccine doses received, and respondents’ concern about new variants of SARS-CoV-2. To assess associations between perceived local COVID-19 transmission level and frequency of use of preventive behaviors during the 2 weeks before SARS-CoV-2 testing and changes in personal behaviors due to perceptions of local COVID-19 transmission, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression models¶¶ adjusted for geographic area, gender identity,*** age group, and combined race and ethnicity. Respondents provided consent electronically. Analyses were conducted using Python software (version 3.8.8; Python Software Foundation) and R software (version 4.2.0; R Foundation) using the R survey package (version 3.29). The Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the study. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†††

Respondents, all adults, included 3,934 residents of the Detroit metropolitan area and 1,000 residents of DuPage County, Illinois. A total of 4,670 (94.6%) surveys were completed within 7 days of associated positive SARS-CoV-2 test results; all surveys were completed within 3 weeks of the associated positive test result.

During May–July 2022 (i.e., the study interval and reference time frame of questions answered by respondents), the Detroit metropolitan area and DuPage County had continuously high levels of local COVID-19 transmission as categorized by publicly available CDC transmission levels.§§§ Among all respondents, 702 (14%) characterized local COVID-19 transmission when surveyed as high, 971 (20%) as substantial, 1,902 (39%) as moderate, 581 (12%) as low, and 778 (16%) did not know (Table). Perceived level of local COVID-19 transmission varied by county, gender identity, age group, race and ethnicity, education, employment status, number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received, self-reported general health status, and respondents’ level of concern about new variants of SARS-CoV-2. Respondents aged 30–59 years were more likely than those aged 18–29 years or ≥60 years to characterize local COVID-19 transmission as high. High perceived local COVID-19 transmission levels were also more common among adults with relatively higher education attainment, more concern about new SARS-CoV-2 variants, and receipt of more COVID-19 vaccine doses. Higher percentages of adults with a high school diploma or less, zero COVID-19 vaccine doses, and no expressed concern about new variants of SARS-CoV-2 indicated that they did not know the level of COVID-19 transmission in their local area.

Multivariable models revealed that perceived higher local COVID-19 transmission among respondents was associated with more frequent participation in preventive behaviors during the 2 weeks preceding SARS-CoV-2 testing (Figure 1). Compared with respondents who characterized COVID-19 transmission as low, those who perceived transmission levels as high were more likely to report having always or often worn masks in public settings (aOR = 3.0; 95% CI = 2.3–3.8), to have worn protective masks (aOR = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.2–3.7), limited travel (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.3–2.1), and avoided crowded places or events (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.3–2.0).

Compared with respondents who characterized local COVID-19 transmission as low, those who perceived local COVID-19 transmission as high were more likely to report changing their preventive behaviors in response to local transmission levels (aOR = 4.4; 95% CI = 3.2–5.0), substantial (aOR = 4.0; 95% CI = 3.2–5.0), or moderate (aOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.8–2.6) (Figure 2). Respondents who characterized local COVID-19 transmission as high were more likely than were those who characterized transmission as low to report having more frequently worn masks in public (aOR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.7–4.1), chosen to wear a more protective mask (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2–2.3), postponed or cancelled travel plans (aOR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.4–3.1), and avoided crowded places or events (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.4–2.8).","In two geographic areas with sustained high 7-day average rates of confirmed COVID-19 transmission during May–July 2022, 50% of adults with recent SARS-CoV-2 infections surveyed during June–July 2022 described the level of COVID-19 transmission in their local area as low or moderate. Persons who perceived local COVID-19 transmission to be high when surveyed were most likely to report changing preventive behaviors in response to local COVID-19 transmission, including more frequently wearing a mask in public, limiting travel, and avoiding crowded events. Further assessment of public perceptions of local COVID-19 levels and their associations with preventive behaviors can help to clarify how communication of pandemic indicators and related policy decisions might influence behaviors. 

Differences in perceived local COVID-19 transmission observed across demographic groups, number of vaccine doses received, and concern about new variants of SARS-CoV-2 highlight the effects of individual risk perception on use of preventive measures. Differences in perceived transmission levels among adults aged 30–59 years and those who were older or younger might reflect differential sources of COVID-19 information or COVID-19 risk perception (6). Perceived transmission level also varied with the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses received. Despite higher risk for severe COVID-19 without vaccine-induced protection, adults who had received fewer COVID-19 vaccine doses more commonly characterized COVID-19 transmission as low compared with adults who had received more COVID-19 vaccine doses. This finding might reflect a decreased likelihood to get vaccinated and to pay attention to COVID-19 transmission levels among people who were less concerned about COVID-19. In addition, even among persons who were very concerned about new variants of SARS-CoV-2, only one in five perceived local COVID-19 transmission to be high, which might be related to reduced media coverage of COVID-19 (4). 

CDC does not recommend that members of the public use transmission levels alone to guide prevention measures. Rather, CDC developed COVID-19 Community Levels, which are measures of the impact of COVID-19 on a community in terms of hospitalizations and health care system strain, while accounting for transmission in the community. As such, calculation of COVID-19 Community Levels incorporates new COVID-19 hospital admissions and percentage of hospital beds occupied by patients with COVID-19, in addition to new COVID-19 cases in a community (7). Although not available at the time this survey was developed,¶¶¶ CDC recommends use of COVID-19 Community Levels data to guide messaging about community and individual preventive actions (8). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, questionnaires were completed by adults who had recently received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, which could have influenced their perceptions about local COVID-19 transmission levels. Relatedly, perceived local COVID-19 transmission levels when surveyed might have differed from perceived transmission levels during reference intervals for behaviors and practices, though transmission levels in both areas were sustainably high during the entire study interval and reference time frame (May–July 2022). Second, some respondents might have been aware of the CDC COVID-19 Community Level site and responded to survey questions accordingly, resulting in relatively lower reported perceived local COVID-19 transmission levels. Third, respondents might have overreported use of preventive behaviors because of social desirability (9), and this study did not assess whether reported behavioral changes occurred before or after respondents received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Fourth, this nonrandom convenience sample is subject to selection bias related to COVID-19 test-seeking, and the survey sample does not represent all county residents who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during the study interval. Finally, the number of persons who received survey invitations and were eligible to consent to participate is unknown, precluding a reliable response rate estimate. 

This analysis found that a low percentage of surveyed U.S. adults perceived local COVID-19 transmission to be high despite sustained documented high transmission levels, and that those who perceived local transmission to be high were more likely to practice behaviors to protect themselves and others from COVID-19. Continued monitoring of public perceptions of local COVID-19 levels, and developing a better understanding of their influence on use of preventive behaviors, can guide COVID-19 communication strategies and policy making during and beyond the pandemic.

Infants aged <6 months, who are ineligible for vaccination, have high COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates compared with other pediatric age groups.

What is added by this report?

Although population-based COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates among infants aged <6 months increased in the Omicron variant–predominant periods compared with the Delta variant–predominant period, indicators of the most severe disease among hospitalized infants aged <6 months did not.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Pregnant women should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination to help protect themselves and infants too young to be vaccinated. Nonpharmaceutical measures should be used to help protect infants ineligible for vaccination.

COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates are highest among adults aged ≥65 years (1); however, COVID-19 can and does cause severe and fatal outcomes in children, including infants (2,3). After the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) BA.1 variant in December 2021, hospitalizations among children aged <5 years, who were ineligible for vaccination, increased more rapidly than did those in other age groups (4). On June 18, 2022, CDC recommended COVID-19 vaccination for infants and children aged ≥6 months (5). Data from the Coronavirus Disease 2019–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET)* were analyzed to describe changes in the age distribution of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations since the Delta-predominant period (June 20–December 18, 2021)† with a focus on U.S. infants aged <6 months. During the Omicron BA.2/BA.5–predominant periods (start highlightMarch 20end highlight–August 31, 2022), weekly hospitalizations per 100,000 infants aged <6 months increased from a nadir of 2.2 (week ending April 9, 2022) to a peak of 26.0 (week ending July 23, 2022), and the average weekly hospitalization rate among these infants (13.7) was similar to that among adults aged 65–74 years (13.8). However, the prevalence of indicators of severe disease§ among hospitalized infants did not increase since the B.1.617.2 (Delta)-predominant period. To help protect infants too young to be vaccinated, prevention should focus on nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccination of pregnant women, which might provide protection through transplacental transfer of antibodies (6).

COVID-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated hospitalizations among residents of predefined surveillance catchment areas.¶ COVID-19–associated hospitalizations are defined as receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular or rapid antigen detection test result during hospitalization or during the 14 days preceding hospital admission. Demographic data were collected on all COVID-19–associated hospitalizations in 13 states and used to calculate age-stratified hospitalization rates.** Clinical data (signs and symptoms at admission,†† underlying medical conditions, and indicators of severe disease) were available for infants aged <6 months from 12 states.§§ Using previously described methods (4), clinical data were collected on all infant COVID-NET cases. Because of the surge in hospitalizations during December 2021 and January 2022, some sites abstracted clinical data on a representative sample of hospitalized infants.¶¶ A birth hospitalization was defined as the hospitalization during which the infant was born.

This analysis describes weekly COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates (hospitalizations per 100,000 population) and clinical characteristics of infants aged <6 months during June 20, 2021–August 31, 2022, which includes SARS-CoV-2 Delta (June 20–December 18, 2021), Omicron BA.1 (December 19, 2021–March 19, 2022), Omicron BA.2 (March 20–June 18, 2022), and Omicron BA.5 (June 19–August 31, 2022) variant–predominant periods. Hospitalization rates from the pre-Delta period and among all other age groups are included for comparison. Average weekly rates and demographic and clinical characteristics of infants aged <6 months were compared across variant-predominant periods. Unadjusted weekly COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates were calculated by dividing the total number of hospitalized patients by population estimates within each age group for the counties included in the surveillance catchment area.*** Because population estimates are available in 1-year age increments, population denominators for hospitalization rates among infants aged <6 months were calculated as one half the population estimate for infants aged <1 year. Three-week moving averages are presented for visualization purposes. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated. Demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, and severity across SARS-CoV-2 variant-predominant periods were compared; the Omicron BA.2- and BA.5-predominant periods were combined in analyses because of small sample sizes. During the combined Omicron BA.2/BA.5-predominant period, the proportions of hospitalized infants with underlying medical conditions and symptoms on admission by age group (<1 month, 1–3 months, 4–5 months) were estimated. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and chi-square tests were used to compare medians and proportions, respectively; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Percentages were weighted to account for the probability of selection for sampled cases, and further adjusted to account for nonresponse (i.e., an incomplete chart review). Data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†††

During the Omicron BA.2/BA.5-predominant period, the weekly hospitalization rate among infants aged <6 months increased elevenfold (95% CI = 4.3–33.3) from a nadir of 2.2 (week ending April 9, 2022) to a peak of 26.0 (week ending July 23, 2022) and began to decline thereafter (Figure). The mean weekly hospitalization rate in this group was higher during the Omicron BA.2/BA.5 period (13.7) than during the Delta period (8.3) (RR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.4–1.8). Compared with the Delta period, rates were also higher during the BA.2/BA.5 period among infants and children aged 6 months–4 years (RR = 1.9) and adults aged ≥75 years (RR = 1.4) but lower among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years (RR = 0.9), adults aged 18–64 years (RR = 0.5), and adults aged 65–74 years (RR = 0.8). The mean weekly hospitalization rate among infants aged <6 months during the Omicron BA.2/BA.5 period (13.7) was less than that of adults aged ≥75 years (39.4), similar to that of adults aged 65–74 years (13.8) and higher than rates in all other pediatric age groups (2.3 and 0.8 for children aged start highlight6 months–4 years and 5–17 yearsend highlight, respectively) and in adults aged <65 years (start highlight4.6end highlight).

Complete clinical data were available for 1,116 infants aged <6 months hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, including 321, 322, and 473 infants hospitalized during the Delta, Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.2/BA.5 periods, respectively (Table 1). Differences during the three periods were small, and not all were statistically significant; however, indicators of severity, including length of hospital stay, and the proportion of hospitalizations that required intensive care unit admission, high-flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilation, or bilevel positive airway pressure/continuous positive airway pressure (BiPAP/CPAP) were consistently lower during the Omicron BA.2/BA.5 period than during the Delta period, and in-hospital deaths were rare (<1%).

Among 473 infants aged <6 months hospitalized during the Omicron BA.2/BA.5 variant-predominant period, 397 (84%) had COVID-19–related symptoms. Among all 473 infants, 174 (38%) were aged <1 month; 69 (39%) of these were birth hospitalizations (Table 2). Among infants who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during the birth hospitalization, 60 (87%) were asymptomatic. Excluding birth hospitalizations, similar proportions were hospitalized with COVID-19–related symptoms among infants aged <1 month (94%), 1–2 months (97%) and 3–5 months (96%). At least one underlying medical condition was present in 26% of hospitalized infants aged 1–2 months and 36% of those aged 3–5 months. Prematurity§§§ was the most frequently reported underlying condition (20% and 25% of infants aged 1–2 months and 3–5 months, respectively). Most infants aged 1–2 months (74%) and 3–5 months (68%) had fever on admission.","Compared with the Delta variant–predominant period, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates increased among infants aged <6 months during Omicron variant–predominant periods, but the proportion of hospitalized infants aged <6 months with indicators of the most severe illness did not increase. Among infants aged <6 months, the average weekly COVID-19–associated hospitalization rate during the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2/BA.5 variant–predominant period was similar to that among adults aged 65–74 years and higher than that in other pediatric age groups and younger adults. These findings underscore the continued risk for COVID-19–associated hospitalization among infants aged <6 months, who are ineligible for vaccination. 

Multiple factors likely contributed to high COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates among young infants during the Omicron variant–predominant period, including the high infectivity and community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and the relatively low threshold for hospitalizing infants for signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., fever) relative to that in older children (7). 

High relative hospitalization rates in infants compared with older children, adolescents, and adults aged <65 years during the Omicron BA.2/BA.5 variant–predominant period also reflect lower rates of hospitalization in these other age groups compared with those during the Delta variant–predominant period, as immunity in older age groups has increased through vaccination,¶¶¶ previous infection, or both.**** 

Because infants are more likely to be immunologically naïve, and vaccines are not approved for infants aged <6 months (8), maternal COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy might help to protect young infants. Maternal completion of a 2-dose primary monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series during pregnancy has been estimated to be 52% effective against COVID-19 hospitalization among infants aged <6 months. This suggests that young infants might receive protection through passive transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies acquired through maternal vaccination. Effectiveness of maternal vaccination in preventing disease in young infants was lower during the early Omicron variant–predominant period (38%) than during the Delta variant–predominant period (80%) (9). Surveillance data show that compared with earlier periods, during the recent Omicron variant–predominant periods, a larger proportion of pregnant women received a vaccination series before pregnancy (9,10). Because of immune evasion when novel variants have emerged and waning immunity as time since the last dose increases, infants born during the Omicron BA.5 variant–predominant period might have had less protection. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, population estimates for infants aged <6 months were not available; therefore, the assumption was that they accounted for one half of infants aged <1 year when calculating rates. This assumption does not account for seasonality in births,†††† which was affected by the pandemic; births typically peak in the summer, leading to potential small overestimates of rates during Omicron BA.2/BA.5 variant–predominant periods. Second, it was not possible to account for changes in public health policies and testing and treatment practices over time. Third, maternal vaccination or previous infection, which might confer some immunity to infants, was not assessed. Fourth, periods of variant predominance are based on national data and might not reflect regional differences in circulating variants. Finally, the COVID-NET catchment areas include approximately 10% of the U.S. population; these findings might not be nationally generalizable. 

Although these findings do not suggest increased severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized infants, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in infants aged <6 months were higher during the Omicron variant–predominant periods (December 2021–August 2022) than they were during previous periods. Maternal vaccination has been shown to provide protection to infants aged <6 months who are currently ineligible for vaccination (9), and both CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend COVID-19 vaccination for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future.§§§§ 

COVID-19 hospitalization rates in infants aged <6 months are higher than those of all other age groups except adults aged ≥65 years. To help protect both pregnant women and infants too young to be vaccinated, prevention should focus on ensuring that pregnant women stay up to date on COVID-19 vaccines¶¶¶¶ (including receiving a bivalent booster dose)***** and implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 prevention (6) and newborn care.†††††","Corresponding author: Sarah Hamid, tsl4@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Hamid S, Woodworth K, Pham H, et al.

Human cases of dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) have decreased from an estimated 3.5 million in 1986 to 15 in 2021. Emergence of Guinea worm infections in dogs in 2012 has complicated eradication efforts.

What is added by this report?

Fifteen cases in humans were reported in 2021 and three during January–June 2022. As of November 2022, dracunculiasis remained endemic in five countries (Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan).

What are the implications for public health practice?

With only 15 human cases identified in 2021 and three during January–June 2022, program efforts appear to be closer to reaching the goal of eradication. However, dog infections and impeded access because of civil unrest and insecurity in Mali and South Sudan continue to be the greatest challenges for the program.

Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease), caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis, is acquired by drinking water containing small crustacean copepods (water fleas) infected with D. medinensis larvae. Recent evidence suggests that the parasite also appears to be transmitted by eating fish or other aquatic animals. About 1 year after infection, the worm typically emerges through the skin on a lower limb of the host, causing pain and disability (1). No vaccine or medicine is available to prevent or treat dracunculiasis. Eradication relies on case containment* to prevent water contamination and other interventions to prevent infection, including health education, water filtration, treatment of unsafe water with temephos (an organophosphate larvicide), and provision of safe drinking water (1,2). CDC began worldwide eradication efforts in October 1980, and in 1984 was designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the technical monitor of the Dracunculiasis Eradication Program (1). In 1986, with an estimated 3.5 million cases† occurring annually in 20 African and Asian countries§ (3), the World Health Assembly called for dracunculiasis elimination. The Guinea Worm Eradication Program (GWEP),¶ led by The Carter Center and supported by partners that include WHO, UNICEF, and CDC, began assisting ministries of health in countries with endemic disease. In 2021, a total of 15 human cases were identified and three were identified during January–June 2022. As of November 2022, dracunculiasis remained endemic in five countries (Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan); cases reported in Cameroon were likely imported from Chad. Eradication efforts in these countries are challenged by infection in animals, the COVID-19 pandemic, civil unrest, and insecurity. Animal infections, mostly in domestic dogs, some domestic cats, and in Ethiopia, a few baboons, have now surpassed human cases, with 863 reported animal infections in 2021 and 296 during January–June 2022. During the COVID-19 pandemic all national GWEPs remained fully operational, implementing precautions to ensure safety of program staff members and community members. In addition, the progress toward eradication and effectiveness of interventions were reviewed at the 2021 and 2022 annual meetings of GWEP program managers, and the 2021 meeting of WHO’s International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication. With only 15 human cases identified in 2021 and three during January–June 2022, program efforts appear to be closer to reaching the goal of eradication. However, dog infections and impeded access because of civil unrest and insecurity in Mali and South Sudan continue to be the greatest challenges for the program. This report describes progress during January 2021–June 2022 and updates previous reports (2,4).

In affected countries, the national GWEP receives monthly case reports from supervised volunteers in each village under active surveillance.** Villages in which endemic transmission has ended (i.e., zero human cases or animal infections reported for ≥12 consecutive months) are kept under active surveillance for 2 additional years. WHO certifies a country as dracunculiasis-free after adequate nationwide surveillance for ≥3 consecutive years with no indigenous human cases or animal infections.††

Since 1986, WHO has certified 199 countries, areas, and territories as dracunculiasis-free; only the five countries with endemic dracunculiasis, plus the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan still lack certification.§§ Representatives of seven countries with current or former endemic dracunculiasis, the United Arab Emirates, The Carter Center, and WHO renewed their commitment to completing Guinea worm eradication at a Guinea Worm Summit in Abu Dhabi in March 2022.

In 2021, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan reported 15 human cases compared with 27 human cases in 2020, the smallest number of human cases ever reported annually (Table 1). Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, and Mali reported 863 infected animals (mostly dogs), compared with 1,601 animal infections reported in 2020. During January–June 2022, three human cases and 296 infected animals were reported, representing 40% and 34% reductions in human cases and animal infections, respectively, compared with five human cases and 450 infected animals reported during January–June 2021 (Table 2). During January–June 2022, CDC received 20 specimens from humans for morphologic or molecular identification, including three (15%) that were laboratory-confirmed D. medinensis¶¶ (Table 3), compared with 13 specimens received and five (38%) confirmed during January–June 2021. During the first 6 months of 2022, CDC received 12 animal specimens, 10 of which were laboratory-confirmed D. medinensis, compared with six confirmed among 36 specimens received during January–June 2021. Previous genetic studies confirmed that Guinea worms collected from both animals and humans are D. medinensis (5). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.***

Country Reports
Angola. Details of the unexpected discovery of dracunculiasis in three persons during 2018–2020 who had no history of foreign travel and in one dog in 2019 have been described. During March 29, 2020–March 28, 2022, no cases among humans or dogs were detected during ongoing active surveillance in 61 villages and routine integrated case searches (e.g., during National Immunization Days); seven infected dogs were detected during March–May 2022 in the same province as the previous human cases and dog infections (Table 2). Angola offers cash reward equivalent to US$450 for reporting an infected human or animal. Genetic analysis of Angola’s Guinea worm specimens did not help elucidate a source because no clear link to other previously analyzed D. medinensis was detected (6).

Chad. Chad reported eight human cases among eight villages in 2021 (Table 1). During the first half of 2022, Chad reported three human cases, compared with four human cases reported during January–June 2021. In 2021, Chad reported 833 animal infections (767 dogs and 66 cats), compared with 1,571 (1,508 dogs and 63 cats) reported in 2020 (Table 2). During January–June 2022, 43% fewer infected dogs (239) and 67% more infected cats (25) were reported compared with data from January–June 2021. In Chad, transmission of D. medinensis is hypothesized to have occurred from consumption of inadequately cooked fish, other aquatic transport hosts, or paratenic hosts (infected hosts in which the larval parasite does not develop) (7). As of June 2022, The Carter Center has been helping Chad’s Ministry of Health in implementing village-based surveillance for animal and human infections in 2,438 at-risk villages, an increase of 80 villages compared with the 2,358 in December 2021 (Table 1). The active surveillance generated 41,135 rumored reports about possible Guinea worm infections among humans or dogs during January–June 2022, a 33% decline compared with 61,341 rumored reports during the same period in 2021.

Since 2010, Chad’s Ministry of Health has offered a reward equivalent to US$100 for reporting a confirmed human dracunculiasis case. In addition, since 2013, Chad’s GWEP implemented educational interventions to avoid transmission through fish or fish entrails. Reporting and tethering dogs with dracunculiasis-compatible signs started in 2014, and this intervention was enhanced in 2015 with a US$20 equivalent reward for reporting confirmed infected dogs. In 2017, the program initiated the systematic use of temephos, focusing on small ponds in villages with the most infected dogs, and launched a nationwide communication campaign to increase awareness about the reporting and prevention of Guinea worm infection. In March 2020, Chad launched a new strategy to tether all dogs proactively during the 4 months of peak dracunculiasis incidence in all villages with five or more dracunculiasis infections during the previous year, and is currently working to expand proactive tethering among all villages reporting one or more dog infections.

Since June 2017, monitoring and evaluation efforts have indicated that approximately 81% of households assessed monthly in at-risk communities were burying fish entrails to avoid consumption by dogs, and 81% and 70% of eligible dogs were tethered in 2021 and during January–June 2022, respectively. The decrease in tethering coverage reflects the expansion of the intervention in 2022 to include all villages with one or more infections compared with 2021 when only villages with three or more infections were included. Water treatment with temephos reached 61% of 348 villages with dog (340) or human (eight) infections by December 2021 and 68% of 82 villages by June 2022. In December 2021, 79% of villages reporting infections among dogs or humans had at least one source of copepod-free drinking water. In areas under surveillance in Chad, 92% of residents surveyed in 2021, and 70% of those surveyed during January–June 2022 were aware of the cash rewards for reporting human or animal infections. These additional actions might be favorably affecting the elimination of dracunculiasis, and these effects will continue to be assessed.

Cameroon. Cameroon reported 10 infected dogs in 2021 and 23 during January–June 2022 (Table 2) in an area <3 miles (5 km) from the Chad-Cameroon border. Investigations indicate that dogs were likely infected in Chad, because the affected villages include families that permanently live on both sides of the border, and owners of infected dogs reportedly took their dogs to Chad during the period when the dogs would have become infected.

Ethiopia. During 2021, Ethiopia reported one human case and three infected animals (two dogs and one cat); no human case or infected animal was reported during January–June 2022 (Table 2), and for the first time in 9 years, no infected baboons were detected during January 2021–June 2022. For the past several years, all animal infections and human cases have occurred in Gog district of Gambella Region. Since 2017, The Carter Center has supported Ethiopia’s public health and wildlife authorities in a baboon and dog epidemiology project (4). Since 2021, the Ethiopia Dracunculiasis Eradication Program has conducted active surveillance of 198 villages and 201 nonvillage areas (e.g., commercial farms and temporary hunting settlements). The program applies temephos monthly to nearly all water sources known to have been used by humans in the at-risk area of Gog district. Beginning in 2022, remote sensing data from Maxar Technologies is identifying new water sources that need to be treated. Since April 2018, among villages in which infected animals were most commonly detected, Ethiopia has supported villager-initiated, constant tethering of approximately 1,900 dogs and cats to prevent their exposure to water sources in adjacent forests in which transmission apparently occurs (4). In 2018, Ethiopia increased its reward for reporting human dracunculiasis cases to an equivalent of US$360 and for reporting and tethering infected animals to US$40. In 2021, 92% of persons surveyed in active surveillance areas knew of the rewards; in January–May 2022, 96% were aware. In May 2022, the minister of health visited areas with endemic dracunculiasis to promote and support dracunculiasis eradication efforts.

Mali. Mali reported two human cases in 2021, and none during January–June 2022, compared with one case in 2020 and none during January–June 2021 (Table 2). In 2021, one infected cat and 16 infected dogs were reported, compared with nine dogs and no cats in 2020. During January–June 2022, Mali reported two confirmed infected dogs, the same number reported during January–June 2021. Among the 16 infected dogs identified in all of 2021, 10 were detected in Segou Region and six were detected in the adjacent Mopti Region. Segou Region is accessible to the program, but the dogs were bred and apparently became infected in areas of Mopti Region that have remained partly inaccessible to the program since 2012 because of civil unrest. The two infected dogs were detected and reportedly contained during January–June 2022 in Segou Region. In 2021 Mali had 2,216 villages under active surveillance (Table 1), with cash rewards equivalent to US$340 for reporting a human case and an equivalent of US$20 for reporting and tethering an infected animal. In areas under active surveillance in 2021, 90% of persons queried knew of the rewards for reporting an infected person or animal, and in January–June 2022, 92% and 81% knew of the rewards for reporting an infected person or animal, respectively. In addition, Mali introduced proactive tethering of some dogs late in 2021.

South Sudan. South Sudan reported four human cases in 2021, compared with one in 2020 (Table 2). No human cases or infected animals were reported during January–June 2021 or January–June 2022. Only one infected animal has ever been reported (in 2015), which belonged to a household in which a human infection had occurred. The high population mobility of cattle herders and others in South Sudan presents a special challenge, in addition to sporadic insecurity. By December 2021, South Sudan’s GWEP had 2,174 villages under active surveillance (Table 1). The reward for reporting a case of dracunculiasis or an infected animal is approximately equivalent to US$75. A 2021 survey of residents found 84% of respondents knew of the reward for reporting an infected person.","Stopping dracunculiasis transmission among dogs in Chad is now the principal challenge to the GWEP. During January 2021–June 2022, Chad reported 1,108 (94%) of the world’s 1,177 D. medinensis infections, 1,059 (96%) of which were in dogs. In a pattern peculiar to Chad, Guinea worm infections there usually affect many dogs and few humans (7). This challenge is being addressed through innovative interventions and research supported by The Carter Center, WHO, and CDC. Also involved are multiple research institutions helping to understand the unusual epidemiology of dracunculiasis in the remaining affected countries and assessing antihelminthic treatment of dogs (8). Research from the University of Georgia indicated that fish could serve as transport hosts for Dracunculus spp. and that D. medinensis can use frogs as paratenic hosts.††† In addition, Dracunculus larvae have been recovered from multiple wild frogs in Chad (9,10). If the hypothesis that the parasite’s life cycle in Chad involves a transport or paratenic host is correct (10), increased active surveillance, proactive tethering of dogs, temephos application, and fish entrail burial should reduce transmission. The reductions in human cases and infected dogs in Chad in January 2021–June 2022 suggests that these interventions are successful. 

Adequate security is important to achieving eradication goals, especially in Mali and South Sudan. In 2021, Mali reported two human cases, whereas the endemic transmission of Guinea worm among dogs and cats appears to be geographically limited. In 2020, the program in Chad began working with ministry of health, regional, and local leaders in a Peace-Health Initiative to reduce insecurity in one district with endemic dracunculiasis and expanded to four districts in 2022. South Sudan is poised to achieve zero-case status soon as a result of strong technical leadership, strong governmental political support, and no known animal infections, highlighting the importance of maintaining adequate security. 

Areas of transmission in Ethiopia and Angola are limited. In 2021, Ethiopia reported one human case, and animal infections appear to be geographically limited. The ecologic study of baboons and proactive tethering of dogs in Gog district might help clarify the dynamics of residual Guinea worm infections in Ethiopia and identified the likely sources of all four infections in 2021. Now Ethiopia appears close to interrupting transmission. In Angola, three confirmed human cases and seven infected dogs reported between 2018 and 2022 suggest that the problem in this country is limited, but active surveillance throughout the areas at risk, and appropriate control measures and investigations are still needed. 

The identification of dracunculiasis cases in villages in Cameroon that border areas in Chad with endemic dracunculiasis highlights the risks for exportation and the need for ongoing active surveillance and appropriate control measures in neighboring countries (Cameroon and Central African Republic). The current prominence of infections in domestic dogs and cats requires increased measures to limit those animals’ access to water sources for human consumption and waste from discarded fish and other aquatic animals. 

With only 15 human cases identified in 2021 and three during January–June 2022, program efforts appear to be closer to reaching the goal of eradication. However, dog infections and impeded access because of civil unrest and insecurity in Mali and South Sudan continue to be the greatest challenges for the program.","Corresponding author: Vitaliano A.

In the United States, COVID-19 monovalent booster vaccination was previously recommended, but related protection decreased after the emergence of Omicron subvariants.

What is added by this report?

In fall 2022, CDC recommended a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for persons aged ≥5 years, administered ≥2 months after completing the primary series or after receipt of a monovalent booster dose.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Bivalent COVID-19 vaccine booster doses might improve protection against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages and, along with completion of a primary series in persons who remain unvaccinated, are important to protect against COVID-19, particularly among those persons who are at increased risk for severe illness and death.

Four COVID-19 vaccines are currently approved for primary series vaccination in the United States under a Biologics License Application or authorized under an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and recommended for primary series vaccination by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP): 1) the 2- or 3-dose monovalent mRNA BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech, Comirnaty) COVID-19 vaccine; 2) the 2- or 3-dose monovalent mRNA mRNA-1273 (Moderna, Spikevax) COVID-19 vaccine; 3) the single-dose adenovirus vector-based Ad26.COV.S (Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) COVID-19 vaccine; and 4) the 2-dose adjuvanted, protein subunit–based NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) COVID-19 vaccine. The number of doses recommended is based on recipient age and immunocompromise status (1). For additional protection, FDA has amended EUAs to allow for COVID-19 booster doses in eligible persons (1). Because COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated decreased effectiveness during the period when the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2 predominated, bivalent booster doses (i.e., vaccine with equal components from the ancestral and Omicron strains) were considered for the express purpose of improving protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccine booster doses (2). During September–October 2022, FDA authorized bivalent mRNA vaccines for use as a booster dose in persons aged ≥5 years who completed any FDA-approved or FDA-authorized primary series and removed EUAs for monovalent COVID-19 booster doses (1). Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna bivalent booster vaccines each contain equal amounts of spike mRNA from the ancestral and Omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains. After the EUA amendments, ACIP and CDC recommended that all persons aged ≥5 years receive 1 bivalent mRNA booster dose ≥2 months after completion of any FDA-approved or FDA-authorized monovalent primary series or monovalent booster doses.*

Since June 2020, ACIP has convened 33 public meetings to review data relevant to the potential use of COVID-19 vaccines.† The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group (Work Group), comprising experts in adult and pediatric medicine, infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, has met weekly to review COVID-19 surveillance data, evidence for vaccine efficacy, postauthorization effectiveness, safety, and implementation considerations for COVID-19 vaccines. To assess the certainty of evidence for benefits and harms of a bivalent booster dose and guide deliberations, ACIP used the Evidence to Recommendations (EtR) Framework.§ Within this framework, ACIP considered the importance of COVID-19 as a public health problem, including during the Omicron-predominant period, and issues of resource use, benefits and harms, patients’ values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, and equity for use of the vaccines.

Effectiveness of monovalent COVID-19 vaccines was high after vaccine introduction in late 2020. However, declines in vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and COVID-19–associated hospitalization have been observed because of waning protection over time and differences between the virus for which the initial vaccines were designed and currently circulating variants. The Omicron variant, which emerged in November 2021, has increased immune evasion compared with that of earlier variants (2). During the Omicron-predominant period, monovalent mRNA primary series VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19–associated hospitalization was substantially lower and waned over time since vaccination (3). A third monovalent (booster) dose provided increased protection against infection and severe disease during the period of Omicron predominance, but VE of monovalent booster doses against COVID-19–associated hospitalization has also waned over time since receipt of the booster dose, especially during the recent BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 sublineage–predominant periods (3,4).

The goal of a bivalent booster vaccination is to expand the immune response to the currently circulating Omicron variant¶ and improve protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccines against severe disease (2,5). Specifically, the bivalent booster vaccines authorized by FDA contain mRNA encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-hu-1 strain (ancestral) and the identical S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5 (Omicron BA.4/BA.5) sublineages (1).

At the September 1, 2022, ACIP meeting, committee members reviewed evidence demonstrating monovalent VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization during the BA.4/BA.5 period among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years of 49% (95% CI = 20%–68%) at 14–149 days after dose 3 and 34% (95% CI = 25%–42%) ≥150 days after dose 3 (5). Among evidence reviewed for children aged 5–11 years, monovalent VE against emergency department and urgent care visits for COVID-19 was 51% (95% CI = 34%–64%) at 14–59 days after dose 2 and declined to 18% (95% CI = −4% to 35%) ≥150 days after dose 2; among adolescents aged 12–17 years, VE against emergency department and urgent care visits was 63% (95% CI = 48%–73%) ≥7 days after dose 3. These data indicate that VE has declined during a time when the vaccine and circulating variants are different from the version of the virus against which the vaccines were designed to protect; bivalent booster doses might have the potential to improve vaccine protection against newly circulating Omicron variants.

ACIP recommendations for a COVID-19 bivalent mRNA booster dose were also guided by data on immunogenicity and safety from clinical trials of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccines composed of ancestral and Omicron BA.1 strains (5). The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trials included 437 and 315 participants who received 50 μg Omicron BA.1–containing bivalent boosters and 30 μg Omicron BA.1–containing bivalent boosters, respectively.** Among adults aged ≥18 years, geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of neutralization titers 28 days after Moderna bivalent (ancestral and BA.1 variant) booster dose were 1.2-fold higher for ancestral SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 1.8-fold higher for Omicron SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared with titers in those receiving a Moderna monovalent booster dose, thereby meeting superiority criteria.†† Among adults aged >55 years, GMRs of neutralization titers 1 month after a Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent (ancestral and BA.1 variant) booster dose were equivalent for ancestral SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 1.6-fold higher for Omicron SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared with titers in persons receiving a Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent booster dose, meeting noninferiority criteria§§ against the ancestral strain and superiority criteria against Omicron.

In the clinical trials of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent (ancestral and BA.1 variant) booster doses, rates of local or systemic adverse events occurred with similar or lower frequency after a bivalent booster dose than after the second dose of a primary series with the same vaccine (i.e., homologous monovalent booster dose). No serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported for mRNA COVID-19 updated bivalent booster doses (5). A rare risk for myocarditis and pericarditis has been identified after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, primarily in adolescent and young adult males (5). The risk after a bivalent booster dose is not known; however, the observed risk for myocarditis and pericarditis after monovalent mRNA COVID-19 booster doses is similar to or lower than the risk after dose 2 of the primary series. Regular review of safety data, including myocarditis and pericarditis risk after bivalent booster doses, will continue in national safety surveillance systems. Modeling scenarios reviewed during the ACIP meeting showed that, irrespective of the presence of a new variant, vaccination coverage in adults aged ≥18 years similar to coverage for influenza vaccine would lead to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths of >20% and >15%, respectively, compared with a recommendation for adults aged ≥50 years only (5). In addition, absent a new variant, booster doses administered to adults aged ≥18 years in September 2022 were projected to prevent 137,000 more hospitalizations and 9,700 more deaths compared with those prevented by booster doses administered in November 2022.¶¶

Data to guide the pediatric expansions (i.e., to include children aged ≥5 years) for bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines included data on monovalent boosters in both the pediatric and adolescent populations and data on bivalent boosters in the adult population. Recommendations for monovalent booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech were discussed at previous ACIP meetings and were based on 1) safety and immunogenicity of the booster dose, 2) postauthorization safety data after a primary series in children and adolescents and booster doses in adults, and 3) waning VE after a primary series during the Omicron-predominant period.*** Safety and immunogenicity data for monovalent Moderna COVID-19 booster dose vaccination in children aged 6–11 years and adolescents aged 12–17 years were also reviewed by CDC and FDA. Antibody levels obtained 28 days after a Moderna monovalent booster dose compared with titers 28 days after receiving a Moderna primary series in young adults aged 18–25 years demonstrated neutralization titers 4.2-fold and 5.1-fold higher in children aged 6–11 years and adolescents aged 12–17 years, respectively (6). Reactogenicity symptoms were similar to those observed after receipt of booster doses in adults (6).

ACIP also examined data pertaining to equity in consideration of each EtR domain, in line with the COVID-19 ACIP Work Group’s approach to the EtR Framework through the lens of health equity (3). Data reviewed pertaining to health equity included 1) the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 illness, hospitalization, and death among persons of racial and ethnic minority groups; 2) the demographic characteristics of clinical trial populations compared with those of the U.S. population; and 3) the evidence of persistent inequity in receipt of primary series and booster doses, with potential drivers including differences in access, differences in acceptability, and evidence of limitations to feasibility of booster dose implementation.

In its deliberations at the September 1, 2022, meeting, ACIP discussed the rationale for a bivalent booster vaccine for persons in all age groups previously recommended to receive monovalent booster doses. ACIP concluded that the evidence reviewed, including data and considerations from the EtR Framework, supported use of a dose of a bivalent booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in eligible recipients of a COVID-19 primary vaccination series (Box). Since FDA removed the EUAs for mRNA monovalent COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, ACIP repealed its previous recommendations for administration of monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna monovalent boosters for persons aged ≥12 years and adults aged ≥18 years, respectively. During this discussion, ACIP voting members and liaisons underscored the importance of extending the potential benefits of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5–targeting bivalent vaccines to pediatric populations. On October 12, 2022, FDA authorized and CDC recommended bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster doses for children aged 5–11 years. After the EUA amendments, ACIP and CDC recommended that all persons aged ≥5 years should receive 1 bivalent mRNA booster dose ≥2 months after completion of any FDA-approved or FDA-authorized monovalent primary series or monovalent booster dose (Table). The pediatric data described above were reviewed again at the ACIP meeting on October 19, 2022. In addition, persons who recently had a SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying a primary series dose or booster dose by 3 months from symptom onset or a positive test result (if infected person was asymptomatic). Additional supporting evidence for the EtR Framework is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/covid-19-bivalent-booster-etr.html and complete interim clinical considerations are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html.


ACIP emphasized that achieving high and equitable coverage with a COVID-19 primary vaccination series remains the highest priority and is fundamental to reducing COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality, including in younger age groups with lower vaccination coverage. ACIP also stressed the importance of ensuring global equity in access to COVID-19 vaccines for the prevention of disease in vulnerable persons and mitigation of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.

After authorization by FDA on October 19, 2022, CDC recommended use of a monovalent Novavax booster dose (rather than a bivalent mRNA booster dose) in limited situations. These situations include use in adults aged ≥18 years who completed any FDA-approved or FDA-authorized monovalent primary COVID-19 vaccination series, have not received any previous booster doses, and are unable to receive an mRNA vaccine (i.e., mRNA vaccine is contraindicated or not available) or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine and would otherwise not receive a booster dose (7). Additional supporting evidence for the EtR is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recs/grade/covid-19-novavax-adult-booster-etr.html.

Before vaccination, providers should provide the EUA Fact Sheet for the vaccine being administered and counsel vaccine recipients about expected systemic and local reactogenicity. Additional clinical education materials are available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/index.html, including additional clinical considerations at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html. These interim ACIP recommendations and clinical considerations are based on bivalent booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine and might change as more evidence becomes available. At the September meeting, existing recommendations for persons who are immunocompromised were highlighted, including preexposure prophylaxis with the medication Evusheld, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (tixagevimab and cilgavimab) administered every 6 months to persons who are or become moderately or severely immunocompromised, to supplement vaccine-conferred protection (5).


Reporting of Vaccine Adverse Events
Adverse events occurring after receipt of any COVID-19 vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at https://vaers.hhs.gov or 1-800-822-7967. Vaccination providers are required under the provisions of the provider agreements for the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program and by FDA to report vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, cases of myocarditis, cases of pericarditis, and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death after administration of COVID-19 vaccine under EUA. Health care providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant adverse event, even if it is unclear whether the vaccine caused the event. In addition, CDC has developed v-safe, a voluntary, smartphone-based active surveillance system that monitors adverse events occurring after COVID-19 vaccination. Reports to v-safe indicating a medically significant health impact are followed up by CDC’s v-safe call center to collect additional information and complete a VAERS report, if indicated. Information on v-safe is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vsafe.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Hannah G.

Approximately 44% of adults with arthritis report arthritis-attributable limitations, but little is known about arthritis among caregivers. 

What is added by this report? 

During 2017 and 2019, one in five adults in 17 states was a caregiver, and one in three caregivers had arthritis. Prevalence of arthritis was higher among caregivers (35.1%) than among noncaregivers (24.5%). Compared with caregivers without arthritis, those with arthritis provided similar types of care and were more likely to have provided care for more hours per week and for more years and report having disabilities. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Arthritis among caregivers might affect the care they provide, which can be physically demanding. Health care professionals can support caregivers with arthritis and their care recipients by promoting arthritis-related health interventions.

Caregiving provides numerous benefits to both caregivers and care recipients; however, it can also negatively affect caregivers’ mental and physical health (1–4), and caregiving tasks often require physical exertion (1). Approximately 44% of adults with arthritis report limitations attributable to arthritis, including trouble doing daily activities (5). These limitations might affect caregivers’ ability to provide care, but little is known about arthritis among caregivers. To assess arthritis among caregivers of a family member or friend, CDC examined data from 17 states that administered both the arthritis and caregiving modules as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in either 2017 or 2019. Approximately one in five adults (20.6%) was a caregiver. Prevalence of arthritis was higher among caregivers (35.1%) than noncaregivers (24.5%). Compared with caregivers without arthritis, those with arthritis provided similar types of care and were more likely to have provided care for ≥5 years and for ≥40 hours per week. In addition, higher proportions of caregivers with arthritis reported disabilities compared with those without arthritis, including mobility issues (38.0% versus 7.3%). Arthritis among caregivers might affect their own health as well as the care they can provide. Caregivers can discuss their arthritis and related limitations with a health care professional to identify ways to increase their physical activity and participation in lifestyle management programs.* Such interventions might ease arthritis pain and related limitations and might support them in their ongoing caregiving role. Public health professionals can implement strategies to support caregivers throughout the caregiving process.† 

BRFSS is a cross-sectional, random-digit–dialed, annual telephone survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults aged ≥18 years. BRFSS is conducted by state and territorial health departments, and data are weighted to make estimates representative of each state. BRFSS data were analyzed among 17 states§ using the most recent year (2017 or 2019) in which respondents were asked both the caregiving and arthritis module questions (including arthritis-related limitation questions) in the same year. Combined (landline and mobile) median response rates for states used in the analysis were 47.3% (2017) and 45.7% (2019).¶ 

Respondents were classified as caregivers of a family member or friend if they responded “yes” when asked whether they provided care to a family member or friend with a health condition or disability during the past 30 days. Respondents were classified as having arthritis if they responded “yes” when asked if they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they have some form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia. Data were collected from 106,316 respondents; 15,195 (14.3%) respondents who refused to respond, who responded “don’t know/not sure,” or were missing responses on either the caregiving or arthritis question were excluded from the analysis. The final sample size included 91,121 respondents. 

Prevalence of arthritis was compared between caregivers and noncaregivers overall and by selected demographic subgroups and individual states. Bivariate analyses were conducted among caregivers with and without arthritis to assess distributions of characteristics related to caregiving (length of care,** weekly hours of care,†† and type of care provided§§), having a primary care provider, and status of disability types that might be related to arthritis (mobility, self-care, and independent living disabilities).¶¶ Among caregivers with arthritis, prevalence of arthritis-attributable activity and work limitations*** was determined. Distribution of employment status††† was determined among caregivers providing ≥40 hours of caregiving per week by arthritis status to examine employment status among those who provide care full-time. Analyses were conducted using SUDAAN (version 11.0; RTI International) to account for the complex survey design and weighting. Statistical significance was determined at α = 0.05. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§ 

In 17 states during 2017 and 2019, one in five adults (20.6%; 95% CI = 20.1%–21.2%) was a caregiver, and more than one in three (35.1%) caregivers had arthritis (Table 1). Prevalence of arthritis was greater among caregivers than among noncaregivers overall (35.1% versus 24.5%), in each state, and across all demographic subgroups by age group, sex, education status, body mass index category, and inactivity status. Prevalence of arthritis was higher among caregivers than among noncaregivers for most employment statuses, races, and ethnicities. 

Compared with caregivers without arthritis, those with arthritis provided similar types of personal and household care and were more likely to have provided care for ≥5 years (35.1% versus 28.7%) and for ≥40 hours per week (20.9% versus 17.5%) (Table 2). Among adults with arthritis, 49.1% of caregivers reported arthritis-attributable activity limitations, and 39.9% of caregivers reported arthritis-attributable work limitations. Caregivers with arthritis were more likely than were those without arthritis to have the following types of disability: mobility (38.0% versus 7.3%), self-care (9.8% versus 1.5%), and independent living (14.7% versus 5.0%). Among caregivers with arthritis, 91.2% (95% CI = 89.8%–92.4%) reported having a primary care provider. Among caregivers who provided ≥40 hours of care per week, those with arthritis were more likely than those without arthritis to be unable to work (22.6% versus 7.6%) or to be retired (33.1% versus 18.4%) (Figure). 

","Among adults in 17 states, one in five was a caregiver, and one in three caregivers reported arthritis. The prevalence of arthritis was higher among caregivers than among noncaregivers across nearly all demographic subgroups. Caregivers are critical members of the care team. As both the number of persons providing care for friends and family members (1) and the number of persons with arthritis increase (5), supporting caregivers with arthritis can help promote their own health along with the care they provide. 

An estimated 49.1% of caregivers with arthritis reported arthritis-attributable activity limitations. Although not directly comparable, a previous report estimated that 43.9% (95% CI = 42.9%–44.8%) of adults with arthritis reported arthritis-attributable activity limitations during 2016–2018, suggesting that limitations specific to arthritis might be more common among caregivers than among the general population (5). In addition, caregivers with arthritis were more likely to have disabilities with mobility, self-care, and independent living than were caregivers without arthritis, and more than one in five caregivers with arthritis who provided ≥40 hours of care per week reported being unable to work. However, the types of personal and household tasks provided to the care recipient did not differ by arthritis status among caregivers, suggesting that such care might be necessary or expected of caregivers. Taken together, these findings suggest that caregivers with arthritis who have related disabilities and activity and work limitations might experience unique challenges to sustaining the care they provide, including financial insecurity because of loss of paid income (6). 

A higher proportion of caregivers with arthritis also reported providing care for ≥40 hours per week and for ≥5 years than did caregivers without arthritis, suggesting that they might benefit from long-term services and supports. Ensuring that the health and well-being of all caregivers, including those with arthritis, is optimized can help them continue providing quality care. A large proportion of caregivers with arthritis reported having a primary care provider. These caregivers with arthritis can discuss their experiences with their health care provider and seek evidence-based programs for support, such as effective physical activity-based programs and self-management programs to help reduce arthritis symptoms and improve arthritis management and quality of life.¶¶¶,**** Caregivers can also learn more about ways to reduce their risk for developing arthritis or managing arthritis if they have it.†††† 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, because of the cross-sectional nature of BRFSS data, causality among caregiving, arthritis, and other conditions such as disability status cannot be determined. Second, self-reported data might be subject to several biases including recall and social desirability. Third, BRFSS data cannot be validated with medical records. Fourth, data were from 17 states and might not represent all jurisdictions. Finally, statistically significant differences in the prevalence of arthritis between caregivers and noncaregivers were not observed in some racial and ethnic groups, even though estimates were consistently higher among caregivers. 

Caregiving is common in the United States, and many caregivers have arthritis and related limitations and disabilities. Caregivers with arthritis might benefit from interventions to help them continue providing quality care for their friends and family members. Health care professionals can recommend physical activity and lifestyle management programs for arthritis to help their patients who are caregivers to manage their arthritis symptoms.§§§§ Public health professionals can support all caregivers and care recipients by strengthening public health infrastructure using the public health strategist approach,¶¶¶¶ implementing strategies from the Healthy Brain Initiative and Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure Act for supporting caregivers,***** and accessing resources from the National Public Health Agenda for Osteoarthritis (7) and the BOLD Public Health Center of Excellence on Dementia Caregiving††††† (8).","Corresponding author: John D.

Infection is transmitted through direct contact with infectious blood, body fluids, and animal tissues. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, generalized body weakness, and hemorrhage. Since 2000, four outbreaks of EVD caused by Sudan ebolavirus have been identified in Uganda; the largest outbreak (in 2000) resulted in 425 cases and 224 (53%) deaths (2,3). No vaccine is available to prevent Sudan ebolavirus infection, and treatment is supportive. The estimated case fatality rate is 55% (4).

On September 17, 2022, Uganda’s National Public Health Emergency Operations Centre and the Uganda Virus Research Institute VHF program were notified of a suspected VHF case in a male patient (patient A) aged 26 years who lived in Madudu subcounty, Mubende District in central Uganda. The patient had been referred to Mubende Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) the previous day by a private health clinic. At the time of admission, patient A had high fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, chest pain, loss of appetite, dry cough, bloody vomitus, and bleeding from the eyes. He reported no recent travel or known Ebola virus exposures. Based on public health protocols for suspected VHF, the patient was isolated at MRRH by the Mubende District health team to await laboratory test results. Despite supportive treatment, the patient died on September 18, 2022, and the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) was notified. A blood sample collected from patient A on September 17 was confirmed positive for Sudan ebolavirus on September 19; testing by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) had been conducted at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (5). On September 19, local leaders from Madudu and Butoloogo, two contiguous subcounties, reported six community deaths during August 13–September 15 among persons with probable EVD. Upon laboratory confirmation of EVD in patient A, MRRH established an Ebola treatment unit (ETU) to manage patients, and another ETU was activated at Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital in western Uganda.

On September 21, 2022, MoH, the Mubende District health team, and other partners launched a public health emergency response to identify additional cases of EVD. The response focuses on active case finding (initiated in Madudu and Butoloogo subcounties), tracing and monitoring contacts for EVD signs and symptoms, conducting laboratory testing, and providing treatment. A probable case was defined as death in a person with suspected EVD who had a direct epidemiologic link to a confirmed case but did not have laboratory-confirmed infection. A confirmed case was a person with EVD who had received positive laboratory test results by RT-PCR or EVD immunoglobulin M serology. Patients with EVD who were discharged from ETUs with two negative RT-PCR tests 48 hours apart were considered recovered. Contact monitoring consisted of daily temperature checks and EVD symptom screening of persons who had direct (i.e., physical) or indirect contact (e.g., with used linens or utensils, or shared space) with patients with probable or confirmed EVD.

During September 18–October 31, 2022, a total of 130 confirmed and 18 probable EVD cases were identified; symptom onset in the first probable case occurred on August 8 (Figure). On October 31, a total of 1,777 contacts were monitored; among these 1,540 (87%) were successfully monitored on that day. Among probable and confirmed cases, the median patient age is 29 years (range = 1–70 years), 87 (59%) patients are men, and 81 (55%) are residents of Mubende district. Among the 130 confirmed cases, 43 (33%) deaths were reported as of October 31. Sixty-one deaths (probable and confirmed cases) were reported; the median age of decedents was 28 years (range = <1–58 years), and 31 (51%) were women. Eighteen confirmed or probable EVD cases during this period were reported among health care workers; five were linked to a surgical procedure performed on a patient with probable EVD who died on September 17. As of October 31, 45 patients had recovered, 37 patients are undergoing treatment in an ETU, and outcomes are unknown for five.

This report describes the fifth outbreak of EVD caused by Sudan ebolavirus in Uganda since 2000 (2,3). Given continued transmission, public health response to this outbreak is ongoing, including epidemiologic investigation to identify the source of the outbreak.† Persons living in or traveling to Uganda should avoid activities that could result in exposures to infected persons or animals, including direct contact with body fluids or objects contaminated with blood or body fluids. Health care workers caring for EVD patients should adhere to proper infection control practices, including appropriate use of personal protective equipment.§ Public health departments, public health laboratories, and health care workers outside Uganda, including in the United States, should be aware of recommended practices to identify, report, and prevent EVD.¶ Health care providers in the United States and elsewhere should be alert for and evaluate any patients suspected of having EVD, particularly persons who have recently been in the affected areas in Uganda.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Thomas Kiggundu, tkiggundu@musph.ac.ug; tkiggundu@uniph.go.ug.","Suggested citation for this article: Kiggundu T, Ario AR, Kadobera D, et al.

An earlier analysis of 2,891 U.S. monkeypox cases found that up to 99% occurred in men, 94% of whom reported male-to-male sexual contact.

What is added by this report?

CDC’s emergency response focused on surveillance, laboratory testing, medical countermeasures, and education. A total of 26,384 U.S. monkeypox cases were reported during May 17–October 6, 2022. Among 59% of persons with data on gender and recent sexual or close intimate contact, 70% reported recent male-to-male sexual contact. Black and Hispanic persons continue to be disproportionately affected.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Public health monkeypox prevention efforts, including vaccination, should continue to prioritize gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, Black and Hispanic persons, and persons who are immunocompromised.

On May 17, 2022, the Massachusetts Department of Health announced the first suspected case of monkeypox associated with the global outbreak in a U.S. resident. On May 23, 2022, CDC launched an emergency response (1,2). CDC’s emergency response focused on surveillance, laboratory testing, medical countermeasures, and education. Medical countermeasures included rollout of a national JYNNEOS vaccination strategy, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issuance of an emergency use authorization to allow for intradermal administration of JYNNEOS, and use of tecovirimat for patients with, or at risk for, severe monkeypox. During May 17–October 6, 2022, a total of 26,384 probable and confirmed* U.S. monkeypox cases were reported to CDC. Daily case counts peaked during mid-to-late August. Among 25,001 of 25,569 (98%) cases in adults with information on gender identity,† 23,683 (95%) occurred in cisgender men. Among 13,997 cisgender men with information on recent sexual or close intimate contact,§ 10,440 (75%) reported male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC) ≤21 days preceding symptom onset. Among 21,211 (80%) cases in persons with information on race and ethnicity,¶ 6,879 (32%), 6,628 (31%), and 6,330 (30%) occurred in non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), and non-Hispanic White (White) persons, respectively. Among 5,017 (20%) cases in adults with information on HIV infection status, 2,876 (57%) had HIV infection. Prevention efforts, including vaccination, should be prioritized among persons at highest risk within groups most affected by the monkeypox outbreak, including gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM); transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse persons; racial and ethnic minority groups; and persons who are immunocompromised, including persons with advanced HIV infection or newly diagnosed HIV infection.

Epidemiology of Cases
On June 23, 2022, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists approved designating monkeypox as a nationally notifiable disease. Data reported to CDC** by jurisdictions included patient demographic characteristics, history of possible exposure, diagnostic studies performed, and clinical signs and symptoms at onset. Characteristics of monkeypox cases reported during May 17–October 6, 2022, are described and compared before and after July 18, 2022, when five commercial laboratories began testing and substantially expanded capacity and access. This surveillance activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††

During May 17–October 6, 2022, a total of 26,384 monkeypox cases were reported to CDC by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Daily case counts peaked during mid-to-late August (Figure 1). Among 25,678 (97%) persons with monkeypox for whom demographic data were available, the median age was 34 years (range = 0–89 years). From May 17–July 17 to July 18–October 6, the percentage of cases among persons aged 18–29 years increased from 20% to 27%; the percentage of cases among persons aged 30–39 years decreased from 45% to 41% (Table). Among 21,211 (80%) cases in persons with information on race and ethnicity, 6,879 (32%) identified as Black, 6,628 (31%) as Hispanic, and 6,330 (30%) as White. From May 17–July 17 to July 18–October 6, the percentage of cases among Black persons increased 67%, from 21% to 35%, whereas the percentage of cases among Hispanic persons decreased 6%, from 33% to 31%. Among White persons, the percentage of cases decreased 28%, from 39% to 28% (Supplementary Figure 1; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121988).

Among 25,001 (98%) of 25,569 cases in persons with known age who were aged ≥18 years and for whom information on gender was available, 23,683 (95%) occurred in cisgender men. Cisgender men accounted for up to 99% of cases during the week of June 5; this percentage declined to 80% by the week of October 2 (Supplementary Figure 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121989). Among 13,997 cisgender men with information reported on recent sexual or close intimate contact, 10,440 (75%) reported MMSC during the 21 days preceding symptom onset. The percentage of cases in cisgender men who reported recent MMSC decreased over time, from 80% during May 17–July 17 to 67% during July 18–October 6 (Figure 2).

Information on rash was reported by 14,133 (54%) persons with monkeypox, among whom 13,871 (98%) experienced a rash, most frequently on the face (5,478; 40%), genitals (5,006; 36%), and arms (4,563; 33%). Among 5,017 (20%) cases in persons aged ≥18 years with reported information on HIV infection status, 2,876 (57%) had HIV infection. Information on hospitalization was reported for 11,204 (43%) persons with monkeypox, 1,870 (17%) of whom were hospitalized. Six deaths were reported. Information on smallpox or monkeypox vaccination status was provided by 9,197 (35%) persons; 2,882 (31%) had received a vaccine, among whom 1,676 (58%) provided the vaccination date. Among those, 1,670 (99.6%) were vaccinated during the 2022 outbreak (i.e., after May 17). Among those vaccinated during the outbreak with race and ethnicity data available (1,626; 97%), 38% were White, 32% were Black, and 23% were Hispanic.

Public Health Response
Within 1 week of announcement of the first suspected case of monkeypox in a U.S. resident by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in mid-May, CDC launched an emergency response for monkeypox (Figure 1). In addition to enhanced surveillance, the response focused on three strategies: 1) expansion of laboratory testing, 2) use of medical countermeasures for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment, and 3) information dissemination to providers and the public with focus on persons at highest risk within groups most affected by the monkeypox outbreak.

Laboratory and diagnostic support. As a result of smallpox preparedness efforts, an FDA-approved polymerase chain reaction laboratory test capable of detecting nonvariola orthopoxviruses was prepositioned through the Laboratory and Response Network (LRN) before the monkeypox outbreak began. In May 2022, 69 LRN laboratories had capacity to test approximately 6,000 specimens per week, and a positive orthopoxvirus test result was sufficient for clinicians and public health departments to initiate patient isolation and contact tracing. On June 10, CDC received FDA clearance to run the same test with a higher throughput extraction platform. To further increase national testing capacity, CDC provided technical assistance to expand testing to five nationwide commercial laboratory companies who began testing during July 2022, increasing the total U.S. testing capacity more than twelvefold, to 80,000 specimens per week (Figure 1). Since the start of the outbreak, testing volume has averaged 9% of capacity in any given week, ranging from 0.2% during the week May 21 to 23% the week of August 20. As of October 8, 2022, a total of 121,345 specimens had been tested.§§

Medical countermeasures. Licensed vaccines and therapeutics for smallpox are held in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Strategic National Stockpile. The JYNNEOS vaccine was stockpiled for immunization of persons who are immunocompromised in the event of a smallpox outbreak. As such, the vaccine was available to help address the monkeypox outbreak. On June 28, a national vaccination strategy was announced to allocate the limited supply of JYNNEOS vaccine based on population-adjusted incidence and the number of persons with highest risk for disease during the current outbreak.¶¶ On August 9, 2022, FDA issued an emergency use authorization for JYNNEOS to allow intradermal administration of a lower volume of vaccine to adults aged ≥18 years,*** increasing the number of available doses by a factor of 3–5. As of October 10, 2022, a total of 931,155 doses had been administered (3).

Currently, no FDA-approved products for treatment of monkeypox exist. Tecovirimat (Tpoxx) was approved for treatment of smallpox in children and adults during 2018 under FDA’s animal rule, which permits efficacy findings from well-controlled animal studies to support an FDA approval when doing so is not feasible or ethical to conduct a human efficacy trial,††† and is available under an expanded access protocol held by CDC. Tecovirimat is recommended for patients with, or at risk for, severe monkeypox. To reduce disease incidence and facilitate appropriate use of tecovirimat, CDC and FDA reduced the number of required forms and patient samples required for approval of treatment and gave patients the option to see their doctor virtually. A randomized controlled trial led by the National Institutes of Health and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group is underway to determine effectiveness of tecovirimat for treatment of monkeypox, and patients with monkeypox in geographic areas with study sites for this trial are encouraged to enroll.§§§

Provider and public outreach. CDC uses a variety of mechanisms to disseminate information to public health partners and health care providers about the monkeypox outbreak. On May 20, 2022, CDC released the first Health Alert Network Health Advisory on the monkeypox outbreak,¶¶¶ followed by four subsequent advisories. CDC has released clinical considerations for vaccination, treatment, and pain management,**** as well as patient information on treatment and guidance for persons living with HIV infection, women who are pregnant, and children.†††† CDC regularly hosts Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity§§§§ calls, during which subject matter experts provide the latest information and considerations for clinicians to help them identify potential cases, request testing, and care for patients with monkeypox. Approximately 10,000 health care professionals attended the first call, and 6,000 attended the second.

CDC’s community engagement strategy focuses on harm reduction messaging for populations disproportionately affected by the monkeypox outbreak. Building on existing partnerships from CDC’s initiative to end the HIV epidemic by 2030, CDC has engaged with advocates, experts, and groups focused on sexual health of MSM, transgender, non-binary, gender-diverse, queer, and persons of other sexual identities to directly reach and hear from populations disproportionately affected by monkeypox. For example, on October 20, 2022, staff members from CDC’s Monkeypox Response cohosted an Instagram Live session to promote the Vaccine Equity Pilot Program to agencies that serve racial and ethnic minority lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual, and others (LGBTQIA+) youth organizations. CDC developed communication resources to facilitate conversations about safer sex and social gatherings, which aim to reduce stigma and aid in making informed choices when persons are in situations or places where monkeypox is more likely to spread. CDC has also supported pilot programs to ensure that vaccines reach populations that have historically faced health disparities and inequity and might continue to face additional barriers to access.","Before the 2022 outbreak, monkeypox cases were primarily reported in central and western Africa.¶¶¶¶ In contrast, 37% of all global cases reported as of October 6, 2022, during the current monkeypox outbreak were in the United States.***** Previous knowledge of monkeypox and sexually transmitted infections, laboratory and diagnostic supports, medical countermeasures, and provider and public outreach have been critical components of CDC’s public health response. The unprecedented nature of this outbreak has required flexibility and ongoing assessment of evidence to develop current prevention and treatment practices. 

Monkeypox continues to disproportionately affect gay, bisexual, and other MSM. However, the large proportion of cases with missing data on recent sexual or close intimate contact makes generalization of this report’s findings challenging. Tailored, nonstigmatizing communication††††† about risk, transmission, and prevention (4,5) remains a priority during this outbreak. CDC partners with communities to reduce stigma in communication, emphasizing use of inclusive language and prevention and treatment strategies to reduce fear and encourage action. 

The current outbreak also continues to disproportionately affect persons with HIV infection (6). In light of data suggesting a higher risk for severe monkeypox disease among persons with advanced and uncontrolled HIV infection (6,7), it is recommended that persons with suspected monkeypox be offered HIV testing when they initially seek care. Clinicians should consult CDC’s interim guidance on prevention and treatment of monkeypox to potentially reduce severe disease among patients with HIV infection (7). Although six deaths have been reported in the United States and other deaths are currently under investigation,§§§§§ the case fatality rate for monkeypox during this outbreak remains low.¶¶¶¶¶ 

Multiple strategies exist that can help prevent and reduce transmission of monkeypox. Two vaccines, JYNNEOS and ACAM2000, can be used to prevent infection with monkeypox. During this outbreak, JYNNEOS has been used nearly exclusively because of its favorable adverse event profile overall as well as its favorable outcomes in persons who might be immunosuppressed or have other risk factors for severe monkeypox disease such as atopic dermatitis, heart disease, or a serious vaccine component allergy (8). JYNNEOS has not been previously well studied in persons exposed to, or at risk for, monkeypox, although early evidence suggests that vaccination provides some protection against infection (9). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, a substantial amount of case data is missing, which might reduce representativeness of findings reported here. Only 59% of adult cases had information on both gender identity and reported recent sexual or close intimate contact. Second, the percentage of missing data is higher in certain jurisdictions; thus, these findings might overrepresent cases from states with more complete data. Finally, mild cases might be underrepresented in this analysis because affected persons might not have sought testing or treatment. 

CDC continues to evaluate new evidence and intervention strategies for monkeypox prevention and control based on available data. Public health prevention efforts should emphasize vaccination for persons at high risk for Monkeypox virus exposure and prioritize populations most affected by the current outbreak, including MSM, Black and Hispanic persons, and persons who are immunocompromised. Efforts should also focus on reducing stigma when communicating about monkeypox transmission and ensuring equitable access to testing, vaccination, and treatment options to reduce health disparities.

CDC recommended bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccination for persons aged ≥12 years in August 2022; approximately 22.6 million bivalent booster doses were administered during August 31–October 23, 2022. 

What is added by this report? 

Early safety findings from v-safe and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for bivalent booster doses administered to persons aged ≥12 years during the first 7 weeks of vaccine availability are similar to those previously described for monovalent vaccine booster vaccines. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Adverse events reported after a bivalent booster dose appear consistent with those reported after a monovalent booster and are less common and less serious than health impacts associated with COVID-19 illness.

On August 31, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized bivalent formulations of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines; these vaccines include mRNA encoding the spike protein from the original (ancestral) strain of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and from the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants BA.4 and BA.5 (BA.4/BA.5). These bivalent mRNA vaccines were authorized for use as a single booster dose ≥2 months after completion of primary series or monovalent booster vaccination; Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster was authorized for persons aged ≥12 years and Moderna for adults aged ≥18 years.*,† On September 1, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that all persons aged ≥12 years receive an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA booster dose.§ To characterize the safety of bivalent mRNA booster doses, CDC reviewed adverse events and health impacts reported after receipt of bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna booster doses during August 31–October 23, 2022, to v-safe,¶ a voluntary smartphone-based U.S. safety surveillance system established by CDC to monitor adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS),** a U.S. passive vaccine safety surveillance system managed by CDC and FDA (1). During August 31–October 23, 2022, approximately 14.4 million persons aged ≥12 years received a bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech booster dose, and 8.2 million adults aged ≥18 years received a bivalent Moderna booster dose.†† Among the 211,959 registrants aged ≥12 years who reported receiving a bivalent booster dose to v-safe, injection site and systemic reactions were frequently reported in the week after vaccination (60.8% and 54.8%, respectively); fewer than 1% of v-safe registrants reported receiving medical care. VAERS received 5,542 reports of adverse events after bivalent booster vaccination among persons aged ≥12 years; 95.5% of reports were nonserious and 4.5% were serious events. Health care providers and patients can be reassured that adverse events reported after a bivalent booster dose are consistent with those reported after monovalent doses. Health impacts after COVID-19 vaccination are less frequent and less severe than those associated with COVID-19 illness (2). 

The v-safe system allows existing registrants to report receipt of a COVID-19 booster dose and new registrants to enter information about all doses received; registrants can also indicate whether any other vaccines were administered during the same visit. On September 2, 2022, v-safe was modified to allow participants to enter up to 6 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Health surveys sent daily during the first week after administration of each dose include questions about local injection site and systemic reactions and health impacts experienced; registrants can provide additional information about these reactions or health impacts via free text message.§§ CDC’s v-safe call center staff members contact registrants who indicate that medical care was received after vaccination to request more information; registrants are also encouraged to complete a VAERS report, if indicated. 

VAERS accepts reports of postvaccination adverse events from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public.¶¶ Signs and symptoms and diagnostic findings in VAERS reports are assigned Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms (MedDRA PTs) by VAERS staff members.*** Reports of serious events to VAERS during August 31–October 23, 2022, were reviewed by CDC physicians to form a consensus clinical impression based on available data.††† Death certificates and autopsy reports were requested for any report of death. CDC physicians reviewed all available information for each decedent to form an impression about the cause of death. Using selected MedDRA PTs, a search was performed to identify possible cases of myocarditis, a rare adverse event that has been associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (2). 

A bivalent booster dose in v-safe was defined as an age-appropriate mRNA vaccine dose administered on or after August 31, 2022, for registrants who had completed at least a primary series (2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine or 1 dose of Janssen [Johnson & Johnson] vaccine). Local and systemic reactions and health impacts reported during the week after a bivalent booster dose vaccination were described for v-safe registrants aged ≥12 years who received a bivalent booster dose during August 31–October 23, 2022. VAERS adverse event reports after a bivalent booster dose were described by serious and nonserious classification, demographic characteristics, and MedDRA PTs. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). These surveillance activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§

Review of v-safe Data 
During August 31–October 23, 2022, a total of 211,959 v-safe registrants aged ≥12 years reported receiving an age-appropriate bivalent booster dose (Table 1); 1,464 (0.7%) were aged 12–17 years, 68,592 (32.4%) were aged 18–49 years, 59,209 (27.9%) were aged 50–64 years, and 82.694 (39.0%) were aged ≥65 years. Most registrants indicated that a bivalent booster dose was their fourth (96,241; 45.4%) or fifth (106,423; 50.2%) COVID-19 vaccine dose; 122,953 (58.0%) received a Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster dose and 89,065 (42.0%) received a Moderna bivalent booster dose. More than one third (84,450; 39.8%) of registrants reported receiving at least one other vaccination at the same visit as bivalent booster vaccination; 83,005 (98.3%) received influenza vaccine. 

In the week after receipt of the bivalent booster dose, frequency of reporting of local injection site reactions ranged from 49.7% among adults aged ≥65 years to 72.9% among adults aged 18–49 years; the prevalence of reported systemic reactions ranged from 43.5% among adults aged ≥65 years to 67.9% among adults aged 18–49 years (Table 2). The most frequently reported reactions among these age groups after bivalent booster dose vaccination were injection site pain (range = 45.0%–70.5%), fatigue (30.0%–53.1%), headache (19.7%–42.8%), myalgia (20.3%–41.3%), and fever (10.2%–26.3%). 

Reported inability to complete normal daily activities ranged from 10.6% among adults aged ≥65 years to 19.8% among adults aged 18–49 years. Receipt of medical care was reported by 0.8% of registrants; most received care via telehealth (0.3%) or clinic (0.3%) appointment. Hospitalization was reported by 55 (0.03%) registrants. Among 45 registrants with information about the hospitalization available from the v-safe call center or free text message response, 29 indicated that the hospitalization was unrelated to vaccination, 13 completed a VAERS report, and three did not wish to complete a VAERS report.

Review of VAERS Data 
During August 31–October 23, 2022, VAERS received and processed 5,542 reports of adverse events among persons aged ≥12 years who reported receiving a bivalent booster dose (Table 3).¶¶¶ The median recipient age was 60 years (range = 12–101) and 3,559 (64.2%) were female; 939 (16.9%) reports indicated at least one other vaccine was received at the same visit as booster vaccination, of which influenza vaccine was most commonly co-administered (852; 90.7%). 

Events related to vaccination errors (e.g., incorrect product formulation administered, incorrect dose administered, underdose, or wrong product administered) were commonly reported (1,913; 34.5%); among 877 reports of vaccination errors after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech and 1,037 reports after receipt of Moderna bivalent booster doses, 225 (11.8%) reports indicated that an adverse health event had occurred. 

Most VAERS reports (5,291; 95.5%) were classified as nonserious, including 2,762 (94.3%) after Pfizer-BioNTech and 2,530 (96.8%) after Moderna bivalent booster vaccination. The most commonly reported events among nonserious reports were headache (628; 11.9%), fatigue (575; 10.9%), fever (561; 10.6%), pain (524; 9.9%), and chills (459; 8.7%). 

Among 251 VAERS reports classified as serious, five were reports of myocarditis, four were reports of pericarditis, and 20 were reports of COVID-19 disease. The age range of those who experienced myocarditis or pericarditis was 12–78 years and 46–78 years, respectively. Thirty-six deaths were reported; median age of decedents was 71 years (range = 46–98 years). For the four reports of death with sufficient information for review at the time of this report, cause of death included cardiac arrest, dementia, metastatic prostate cancer, and myocardial infarction. CDC has requested medical and vital records for the remaining decedents.","This report provides findings from v-safe and VAERS data collected during the first 7 weeks of bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA booster dose administration among persons aged ≥12 years, when 22.6 million booster doses were administered in the United States. The findings in this report are generally consistent with those from safety data from preauthorization clinical trials of a BA.1 Omicron bivalent booster vaccination.****,†††† 

Reporting frequencies of reactions and health impacts among the 211,959 v-safe registrants aged ≥12 years who received an age-appropriate bivalent booster vaccination are similar to those described after receipt of first and second booster vaccine doses among adults aged ≥50 years (3–5). Among adults aged ≥18 years, reporting frequencies of local and systemic reactions after bivalent booster vaccination decreased with increasing age. This reporting pattern was also observed for primary series COVID-19 vaccination; v-safe registrants aged ≥65 years reported reactions less frequently after primary series doses than did younger adults (6). 

Most reports to VAERS for persons aged ≥12 years after a bivalent booster dose were nonserious (95.5%) and were usually similar to those after first booster vaccination and second booster vaccination among adults aged ≥50 years (3–5). Vaccination errors were among the most common events reported to VAERS (34.5%); most (88.2%) of which did not list an adverse health event. Continued education of vaccine providers could help reduce administration errors. 

Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare adverse events associated with receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (2). To date, five reports of myocarditis and four reports of pericarditis after bivalent booster vaccination were received by VAERS following administration of 22.6 million doses among persons aged ≥12 years in the United States. Reporting rates of myocarditis following COVID-19 mRNA primary series and monovalent booster vaccination were highest among adolescent and young adult males; myocarditis rates after monovalent booster dose in these early data are similar to or lower than those after primary series doses (2,7). In one study, an increased risk of pericarditis was detected in the first week after the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines among males aged 12–50 years and females aged 30–50 years (8). 

Among nonserious reports to VAERS were 258 (4.9%) reports of COVID-19 disease; there were 20 (8.0%) serious reports of COVID-19 disease. Vaccine effectiveness studies have shown that among persons who were diagnosed with COVID-19, previous vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines reduced COVID-19 disease severity, including the risk of hospitalization and death (9,10). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, v-safe is a voluntary program; therefore, data might not be representative of the vaccinated population. Second, as a passive surveillance system, VAERS is subject to reporting biases and underreporting, especially of nonserious events (1). Finally, conclusions drawn from these data are limited by the 7-week surveillance period; safety monitoring will continue during the bivalent booster vaccination program. 

As of October 12, 2022, ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥5 years receive an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA booster dose ≥2 months after completion of a COVID-19 primary series or receipt of a monovalent booster dose (3). Preliminary safety findings after bivalent booster vaccination among persons aged ≥12 years are similar to those after monovalent booster vaccination (3–5). Health care providers and patients can be reassured that adverse events reported after a bivalent booster dose are consistent with those reported after monovalent doses. Health impacts after COVID-19 vaccination are less frequent and less severe than those associated with COVID-19 illness. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates as needed to help guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.","Corresponding author: Anne M.

High routine childhood vaccination coverage achieved during 2015–2019 declined globally for most vaccines during 2019–2021 because of COVID-19 pandemic disruptions. 

What is added by this report? 

In 2021, the estimated global coverage with 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis–containing vaccine as well as the first dose of measles-containing vaccine decreased to 81%, the lowest level since 2008. Globally, 25.0 million children were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated in 2021, 5.9 million more than in 2019. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Reversing declining vaccination trends and addressing immunity gaps, as well as extending previous gains in vaccination coverage beyond prepandemic levels, requires targeted and context-specific approaches that prioritize routine vaccination as an essential health service and improve access to vaccination across the life span.

In 2020, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Immunization Agenda 2030, an ambitious global immunization strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases (1). This report updates a 2020 report (2) with global, regional,* and national vaccination coverage estimates and trends through 2021. Global estimates of coverage with 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis–containing vaccine (DTPcv3) decreased from an average of 86% during 2015–2019 to 83% in 2020 and 81% in 2021. Worldwide in 2021, 25.0 million infants (19% of the target population) were not vaccinated with DTPcv3, 2.1 million more than in 2020 and 5.9 million more than in 2019. In 2021, the number of infants who did not receive any DTPcv dose by age 12 months (18.2 million) was 37% higher than in 2019 (13.3 million). Coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) decreased from an average of 85% during 2015–2019 to 84% in 2020 and 81% in 2021. These are the lowest coverage levels for DTPcv3 and MCV1 since 2008. ​Global coverage estimates were also lower in 2021 than in 2020 and 2019 for bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) as well as for the completed series of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), polio vaccine (Pol), and rubella-containing vaccine (RCV). The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in disruptions to routine immunization services worldwide. Full recovery to immunization programs will require context-specific strategies to address immunization gaps by catching up missed children, prioritizing essential health services, and strengthening immunization programs to prevent outbreaks (3). 

The World Health Organization (WHO) established the Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1974 to protect infants against six diseases through vaccination (e.g., BCG, DTP, Pol, and MCV) (4). Since then, additional vaccines and vaccine doses have been introduced during the first year of life (e.g., HepB, Hib, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV], RCV, and rotavirus) and at older ages (e.g., human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccine in females) (4). WHO and UNICEF produce annual estimates of immunization coverage through review of available country-specific data, including administrative and survey-based coverage†,§ (5). DTPcv3 coverage by age 12 months is an indicator of routine immunization program performance, and DTPcv3, MCV2, 3 doses of PCV (PCV3), and HPV vaccine are indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals.¶ Children who have not received any doses of DTPcv by age 12 months (zero-dose children) represent those with poor access to immunization and other essential health services. Children who receive the first DTPcv dose (DTPcv1) but do not complete the full series are considered incompletely vaccinated. 

WHO and UNICEF global estimates of national immunization coverage for DTPcv1 decreased from 90% in 2019 to 87% in 2020 and 86% in 2021, the lowest level since 2005. In 2021, DTPcv1 coverage ranged from 80% in the WHO African Region to 97% in the European Region (Table 1). DTPcv3 coverage followed similar regional trends. The decline in first and third dose DTPcv coverage during 2019–2021 was largest in the South-East Asia Region (from 94% to 86% for DTPcv1 and from 91% to 82% for DTPcv3). In the Americas, DTPcv1 and DTPcv3 coverage decreased by 3 and 4 percentage points, respectively, during 2019–2021 (Figure). Among the 194 WHO member states, DTPcv1 coverage during 2019–2021 was stable or declined in 170 (88%); DTPcv3 coverage during this period was stable or declined in 167 member states (86%). 

In 2021, 25.0 million children worldwide had not completed the 3-dose DTPcv series, 2.1 million more than in 2020 (22.9 million) and 5.9 million more than in 2019 (19.1 million); 18.2 million (73%) had received no doses, and 6.8 million (27%) were incompletely vaccinated with DTPcv. The number of zero-dose children was unevenly distributed by WHO region, economic classification,** and country eligibility for support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi)†† (Table 2) (Figure). Among 18.2 million zero-dose children in 2021, low-income countries accounted for 5.0 million (27%), whereas middle-income countries had the largest number (12.8 million; 70%). Ten countries (43% of the global birth cohort) accounted for 62% (11.4 million) of zero-dose children: India (2.7 million), Nigeria (2.2 million), Indonesia (1.1 million), Ethiopia (1.1 million), Philippines (1.0 million), Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.73 million), Brazil (0.71 million), Pakistan (0.61 million), Angola (0.55 million), and Burma (0.49 million). Approximately 12 million zero-dose children (69% of the global total) lived in Gavi-eligible countries. DTPcv3 coverage declined sharply in 17 countries that transitioned out of Gavi support,§§ from a weighted average of 82% in 2019 to 70% in 2021, whereas those supported by Gavi were less affected (weighted average of 82% in 2019 compared with 77% in 2021). 

Global MCV1 coverage remained stable during 2015–2019 (85%–86%) but decreased to 83% in 2020 and to 81% in 2021. The largest declines in MCV1 coverage during 2019–2021 occurred in the South-East Asia Region (from 94% to 86%) and the Western Pacific Region (from 95% to 91%) (Table 1). During 2015–2019, coverage with 2 MCV doses (MCV2) increased from 63% to 71%, reflecting second dose introductions in many countries.¶¶ However, MCV2 coverage remained stable thereafter (72% in 2020 and 71% in 2021), with only four additional countries introducing MCV2 during 2020–2021. 

Global coverage during 2019–2021 decreased for all of the following recommended childhood vaccines: BCG, from 88% to 84%; the completed Hib series, from 73% to 71%; RCV, from 69% to 66%; 3-dose HepB series, from 85% to 80%; HepB birth dose, from 44% to 42%; and the third Pol dose, from 86% to 80%. Global coverage with first dose of HPV vaccine among females declined from 20% in 2019 to 15% in 2021, and with the last dose, from 14% in 2019 to 12% in 2021. Global PCV3 coverage was stagnant (50% in 2019, 51% in 2020, and 51% in 2021), and coverage with the final dose of rotavirus vaccine series increased from 40% in 2019 to 49% in 2021.***","Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a widespread decline in childhood vaccinations has occurred globally, putting millions of additional children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Global DTPcv3 coverage declined by 5 percentage points during 2019–2021, meaning that at least 22.9 million children in 2020 and 25.0 million children in 2021 did not access or fully utilize routine immunization services. Immunization outreach services were particularly affected (6), and the most vulnerable populations have experienced the largest impact. Among all WHO regions, the largest declines in DTPcv3 and MCV1 coverage occurred in the South-East Asia Region. 

The continued decline in vaccination coverage during 2020–2021 was likely a result of many factors, including strained health systems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. These stresses have led to challenges with supply chains, human resources, and financing. Increasing vaccine misinformation, disinformation, and hesitancy also likely contributed to declines in some countries (6). The risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks is likely to persist if urgent action is not taken to recover immunization program losses. 

Expanding immunization services to reach zero-dose and incompletely vaccinated children and reducing immunization inequities are key objectives of the Immunization Agenda 2030 (1). Gavi has provided support for vaccines and vaccination services to low- and lower-middle income countries since 2000, helping to improve access and reduce disparities in immunization coverage with high-income countries (7). However, during 2019–2021, vaccination coverage declined more sharply in countries that transitioned out of Gavi support than in those supported by Gavi, underscoring the vulnerability of these systems. As countries develop economically, they potentially become less eligible for external funding and require increased domestic financing for immunization. In times of crisis, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, middle-income countries, which account for an increasing share of unprotected children, might be unable to allocate sufficient resources to immunization programs to reach every child with available vaccines. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, for 18 countries (6% of the global birth cohort) that did not report immunization coverage data for 2021 by July 7, 2022, estimated coverage for 2020 was used.††† Second, because COVID-19 also disrupted survey implementation, estimates for 2021 are less determined by survey data than are estimates for previous years. Third, the estimated numbers of zero-dose and incompletely vaccinated children rely on population estimates that are subject to inaccuracies. Fourth, data quality limitations in some countries might have resulted in inaccurate estimates of administrative coverage, and selection and recall bias could affect survey-based estimates of coverage (5). Finally, coverage estimates do not include statistical uncertainty. 

Reversing worrisome vaccination trends and extending previous gains in coverage beyond prepandemic levels will require targeted and context-specific approaches to eliminate barriers to vaccination, particularly in communities with large populations of zero-dose children. WHO has published strategies and guiding principles for implementing catch-up vaccination and recovering essential immunization services (8–10). Countries are urged to recover immunization services while capitalizing on opportunities from the pandemic response and COVID-19 vaccine rollout to strengthen routine immunization services and increase primary health care resiliency. This can be achieved by prioritizing routine immunization as an essential health service, improving access to vaccination across the life span, strengthening data systems, safeguarding sustainable immunization financing, and building vaccine confidence.","Corresponding author: Audrey Rachlin, arachlin@cdc.gov, 678-815-7361.","Suggested citation for this article: Rachlin A, Danovaro-Holliday MC, Murphy P, Sodha SV, Wallace AS.

Data on epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of monkeypox in persons aged ≤12 years (children) and adolescents during the ongoing 2022 monkeypox outbreak are limited. 

What is added by this report? 

During May 17–September 24, 2022, Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infections in children and adolescents aged <18 years were rare, representing 0.3% of all U.S. cases; none resulted in critical illness or death. Younger children typically acquired MPXV infection after skin-to-skin contact with a household member with monkeypox during caregiving activities; adolescents were most frequently exposed through male-to-male sexual contact. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Additional monkeypox cases in children and adolescents might be prevented through strengthened vaccination efforts and education around preventive measures and sexual health.

Data on monkeypox in children and adolescents aged <18 years are limited (1,2). During May 17–September 24, 2022, a total of 25,038 monkeypox cases were reported in the United States,† primarily among adult gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (3). During this period, CDC and U.S. jurisdictional health departments identified Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infections in 83 persons aged <18 years, accounting for 0.3% of reported cases. Among 28 children aged 0–12 years with monkeypox, 64% were boys, and most had direct skin-to-skin contact with an adult with monkeypox who was caring for the child in a household setting. Among 55 adolescents aged 13–17 years, most were male (89%), and male-to-male sexual contact was the most common presumed exposure route (66%). Most children and adolescents with monkeypox were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (47%) or Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (35%). Most (89%) were not hospitalized, none received intensive care unit (ICU)–level care, and none died. Monkeypox in children and adolescents remains rare in the United States. Ensuring equitable access to monkeypox vaccination, testing, and treatment is a critical public health priority. Vaccination for adolescents with risk factors and provision of prevention information for persons with monkeypox caring for children might prevent additional infections. 

During May 17–September 24, 2022, children and adolescents who received a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result for MPXV, nonvariola Orthopoxvirus (NVO), or generic Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) were identified through national surveillance or during CDC clinical consultations. Demographic and exposure characteristics and clinical features of children and adolescents aged <18 years with monkeypox-compatible symptoms§ who received a positive NVO, OPXV, or MPXV PCR test result were analyzed. In cases for which PCR test cycle threshold (Ct) results were available, persons whose specimens had NVO, OPXV, or MPXV PCR Ct values ≥34 (potentially indicating a false positive test result) and who had atypical clinical features or no known epidemiologic risk factors¶ were excluded. 

Data collected included age; sex; gender identity (among adolescents); race and ethnicity; exposure setting and risk behaviors; monkeypox symptoms and lesion distribution; receipt of JYNNEOS vaccine postexposure prophylaxis, tecovirimat (Tpoxx; SIGA Technologies), topical trifluridine (Viroptic; Pfizer Inc.), or vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV; Cangene Corporation)**; and hospitalization status. Data were stratified by age group (0–4, 5–12, and 13–17 years). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† 

During May 17–September 24, 2022, 83 MPXV infections were identified among children and adolescents aged <18 years, including 16 (19%) in children aged 0–4 years, 12 (14%) in children aged 5–12 years, and 55 (66%) in adolescents§§ (Table 1). Among 28 children aged 0–12 years, 18 (64%) were boys, and 10 (36%) were girls. Most adolescents were male (48; 89%), six (11%) were female, and information on sex was missing for one. Overall, 38 (47%) children and adolescents were Black, 28 (35%) were Hispanic, 10 (12%) were non-Hispanic White, and five (6%) were of another race and ethnicity; data on race and ethnicity were missing for two. 

Among 20 (71%) children aged 0–12 years with available exposure data, 19 were exposed in the household setting; for 17 of these children, the reported exposure was direct skin-to-skin contact that routinely occurs between a child and an adult caregiver. In another instance, fomite transmission (e.g., towels shared with a caregiver with monkeypox) was the suspected route of exposure because the index patient and the child had shared a living space without direct skin-to-skin contact. In the remaining instance, further information about the exposure was unavailable. One nonhousehold exposure occurred when an adult with monkeypox held a child outside the household setting. In two instances, adult caregivers contracted monkeypox after caring for children with monkeypox in household settings; the suspected exposure routes were skin-to-skin contact during diapering and other routine child care activities. 

Among 35 (64%) adolescents with available exposure data, 32 were males with direct skin-to-skin sexual contact as the presumed mode of spread: 23 (72%) reported male-to-male sexual contact, four (13%) reported male-to-female sexual contact, and five (16%) reported sexual contact with a person whose sex was not specified. One female adolescent reported recent sexual contact with a male adolescent, but further details were unavailable; another adolescent who identified as a transgender male reported recent sexual contact with a male adolescent. One female adolescent had shared a bed with another adolescent who had a rash, but further details were unavailable. 

Among the 28 children aged 0–12 years with monkeypox, lesions most commonly occurred on the trunk; no child had anogenital lesions; 10 (36%) received tecovirimat, one (4%) received VIGIV, and three (11%) received topical trifluridine (Table 2). Two children aged 0–4 years were hospitalized with diffuse rash and eyelid involvement; both recovered without complications and were discharged.¶¶ One child aged 5–12 years was hospitalized for periorbital cellulitis and conjunctivitis; this child received oral tecovirimat and topical trifluridine and recovered. 

Among the 55 adolescents, lesions most commonly occurred on the trunk (33, 60%) and the genitals or perianal area (33, 60%). Eight (15%) received tecovirimat. Six (11%) adolescent patients were hospitalized. For five adolescent patients, reasons for hospitalization included pain management, treatment of secondary bacterial infections, and systemic symptoms with rash; three of these adolescents received oral tecovirimat, and whether the other two received tecovirimat is unknown; one adolescent received a new diagnosis of HIV infection during hospitalization. Another adolescent was hospitalized to ensure adequate isolation but had mild symptoms and did not receive monkeypox-directed therapies. All adolescents were discharged and recovered. 

Overall, no children or adolescents received ICU-level care or died. No reported case during the investigation timeframe was known to be associated with sexual abuse. 

Ten distinct instances were investigated in which a child or adolescent with monkeypox attended a child care facility (two) or school (eight) while symptomatic; no instance of secondary transmission in these settings was identified. JYNNEOS vaccination was offered to close contacts in at least four situations, and in one instance more than 15 other students and staff members received JYNNEOS postexposure prophylaxis.","MPXV infections in children and adolescents during May 17–September 24, 2022, constituted a small percentage (0.3%) of total U.S. monkeypox cases, and no children or adolescents with monkeypox received ICU-level care or died. However, consistent with disparities observed during the ongoing monkeypox epidemic (3), which are likely related to longstanding inequities in the social determinants of health,*** monkeypox in children and adolescents occurred disproportionately among Black and Hispanic children and adolescents compared with U.S. race and ethnicity percentage distributions of persons aged <18 years.††† This finding underscores the continued need for public health efforts to ensure equitable access to monkeypox vaccination, testing, treatment, and information about prevention measures. Similar to findings reported from Spain (1), exposure characteristics differed between younger children and adolescents: younger children most often acquired infection after direct skin-to-skin contact with a caregiver or household member known to have monkeypox, whereas exposure characteristics among adolescents were similar to those most commonly reported among adults (i.e., sexual contact) (3). Adults with monkeypox who interact with children in the household setting should follow transmission prevention guidelines, which outline measures to prevent the spread of monkeypox in households (4), and caregivers who are symptomatic and believe they might have been exposed should try to limit skin-to-skin contact with children, including by covering lesions. In addition, health care providers caring for sexually active adolescents, particularly males who have male-to-male sexual contact, should consider offering vaccination, should provide education on prevention of monkeypox, and should provide testing for HIV and other STIs (5). 

Limited data, based on infections involving Clade I MPXV rather than the Clade IIb virus causing the current epidemic, suggested that children aged <8 years might be at higher risk for severe disease than are older persons (6,7). However, the clinical signs and symptoms reported in children and adolescents in this report were broadly similar to findings from Spain and U.S. national surveillance data for cases overall (1,3), with most children experiencing a mild-to-moderate clinical course. Clinicians caring for children and adolescents should be aware of available clinical guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of monkeypox§§§ and of the potential for severe disease, particularly in persons with profound immunocompromise (e.g., those with advanced HIV disease or undergoing chemotherapy for cancer) (8). 

No secondary transmission was identified during instances when children attended school or a child care facility while symptomatic, although incomplete case ascertainment and reporting might have limited detection of such events. The absence of known secondary transmission in schools and child care facilities despite the presence of symptomatic persons in these settings suggests that widespread child-to-child transmission might be unlikely.¶¶¶ Regardless of age, contacts of persons with monkeypox should be monitored, and JYNNEOS vaccination postexposure prophylaxis should be considered based on an exposure risk assessment and individual risk for severe disease (7,9). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, data regarding exposure characteristics were missing for one third (34%) of children and adolescents aged <18 years, potentially because of difficulty reaching caregivers or adolescents for interviews or interviewee reluctance to disclose potentially sensitive information because of fear of stigma. Second, exposure misclassification might have occurred because of recall or social desirability bias. Finally, this report could potentially underestimate the number of MPXV infections occurring if children and adolescents aged <18 years with monkeypox did not receive testing. Nonetheless, caution is needed when ordering monkeypox tests and interpreting laboratory results for persons with low pretest probability of infection, because false positive test results can lead to unnecessary or inappropriate medical treatment (10). 

This analysis found that monkeypox in children and adolescents aged <18 years has been rare during the current outbreak and most infections were not severe. Public health messaging should emphasize transmission prevention guidelines for persons with monkeypox who interact with newborns, infants, and children in household settings (4,9). In addition, health care providers caring for sexually active adolescents, particularly male adolescents who have male-to-male sexual contact, should encourage vaccination for eligible persons and should provide testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.","Corresponding author: Ian Hennessee, ihennessee@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Hennessee I, Shelus V, McArdle CE, et al.

Severe manifestations of monkeypox in immunocompromised persons have been observed in previous outbreaks. 

What is added by this report? 

During August–October 2022, CDC provided clinical consultation for 57 hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of monkeypox, most of whom were Black men with AIDS. Delays were observed in initiation of monkeypox-directed therapies. Twelve patients died, and monkeypox was a cause of death or contributing factor in five patients to date, with several other deaths still under investigation. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Clinicians should consider early treatment with available therapeutics for those at risk for severe monkeypox disease, particularly patients with AIDS. Engaging all persons with HIV in care remains a critical public health priority.

As of October 21, 2022, a total of 27,884 monkeypox cases (confirmed and probable) have been reported in the United States.§ Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men have constituted a majority of cases, and persons with HIV infection and those from racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately affected (1,2). During previous monkeypox outbreaks, severe manifestations of disease and poor outcomes have been reported among persons with HIV infection, particularly those with AIDS (3–5). This report summarizes findings from CDC clinical consultations provided for 57 patients aged ≥18 years who were hospitalized with severe manifestations of monkeypox¶ during August 10–October 10, 2022, and highlights three clinically representative cases. Overall, 47 (82%) patients had HIV infection, four (9%) of whom were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) before monkeypox diagnosis. Most patients were male (95%) and 68% were non-Hispanic Black (Black). Overall, 17 (30%) patients received intensive care unit (ICU)–level care, and 12 (21%) have died. As of this report, monkeypox was a cause of death or contributing factor in five of these deaths; six deaths remain under investigation to determine whether monkeypox was a causal or contributing factor; and in one death, monkeypox was not a cause or contributing factor.** Health care providers and public health professionals should be aware that severe morbidity and mortality associated with monkeypox have been observed during the current outbreak in the United States (6,7), particularly among highly immunocompromised persons. Providers should test all sexually active patients with suspected monkeypox for HIV at the time of monkeypox testing unless a patient is already known to have HIV infection. Providers should consider early commencement and extended duration of monkeypox-directed therapy†† in highly immunocompromised patients with suspected or laboratory-diagnosed monkeypox.§§ Engaging all persons with HIV in sustained care remains a critical public health priority. 

During the ongoing monkeypox outbreak, CDC has provided consultation upon request to jurisdictions and clinicians treating patients with monkeypox.¶¶ This report describes the patients from these consultations who were aged ≥18 years and were hospitalized with probable or confirmed monkeypox during August 10–October 10, 2022; the report includes detailed histories for three patients who experienced severe manifestations of monkeypox. CDC obtained data on patient demographic characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes during consultation with health departments or providers. Patient permission for the use of clinical images was obtained. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*** 

During August 10–October 10, 2022, CDC provided consultation for 57 patients aged ≥18 years who were hospitalized with severe manifestations of monkeypox (Table 1). Among 57 patients, 54 (95%) were male, and the median age was 34 years (range = 20–61 years). Forty-seven (82%) had HIV infection; among these patients, 31 (72%) of 43 with a known CD4 count had <50 CD4 cells/mm3 (Table 2). Two patients (4%), one of whom had HIV infection, were undergoing chemotherapy for a hematologic malignancy, three (5%) were solid organ transplant recipients, and three (5%) were pregnant. Overall, most patients were Black (68%), and 13 (23%) were experiencing homelessness.††† 

All patients had severe dermatologic manifestations, and 39 (68%) also had severe mucosal lesions (Table 1). Some experienced involvement of other organs, including the lungs (12, 21%), eyes (12, 21%), and brain or spinal cord (four, 7%). Overall, 53 (93%) patients received oral tecovirimat, and 37 (65%) received intravenous tecovirimat; 29 (51%) patients received vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV),§§§ and 13 (23%) received intravenous cidofovir. All patients who received cidofovir or VIGIV also received tecovirimat. Seventeen (30%) patients received ICU-level care and 12 (21%) died: monkeypox was a cause of death or contributing factor in five of these cases, six deaths remain under investigation to determine whether monkeypox was a causal or contributing factor, and in one death, monkeypox was not a cause or contributing factor.

Representative Case Descriptions 
Patient A. In August 2022, a Hispanic or Latino man in his 20s with no known past medical history was evaluated at an emergency department for back pain and a diffuse rash (location not specified). He was prescribed a course of prednisone for the back pain. Swabs were taken from the lesions to test for Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) by PCR, and the results were positive two days later. Over the next week, the patient’s rash progressed to involve his entire body. He was admitted to a hospital after being evaluated for dyspnea on exertion, dry cough, persistent back pain, and painful left neck swelling. On admission, he was febrile (102.8°F [39.3°C]), and he had a diffuse rash with central ulcerations as well as eschars on his face, trunk, and extremities; oral lesions; and a left neck mass. Laboratory results indicated a positive test result for HIV (CD4 = 79 cells/mm3, CD4 T-lymphocyte percentage 3%). According to state reporting, the patient had received a positive HIV test result in 2020 but was subsequently lost to follow-up. A computed tomography scan of his neck identified a 6.9 x 7.7 x 9.8–cm mass and extensive bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. On hospital day 2, the patient became somnolent and was transferred to ICU; the next day, he was intubated for airway protection and received intravenous tecovirimat. He developed vasopressor-resistant hypotension, experienced a seizure, and went into kidney failure. During the next several days he was treated with vasopressors, antiepileptics, antibiotics, and antifungals, and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An extensive evaluation for infectious agents other than OPXV and HIV was negative. On the second day in ICU, he received 1 dose of VIGIV. Two days later, a brain scan indicated poor perfusion. The family elected to transition the patient to comfort measures. He was terminally extubated. An autopsy was conducted, with pathologic findings of necrosis in multiple tissues consistent with diffuse monkeypox. Immunohistochemistry testing demonstrated extensive orthopoxviral antigen in multiple tissues. Cytomegalovirus antigen was also detected in some tissues.¶¶¶ 

Patient B. In July 2022, a Black man in his 30s with AIDS (CD4 <10 cells/mm3) and not receiving ART developed a rash on his face, head, back, and genitals. At multiple subsequent clinic visits, he was tested and treated for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis; however, his genital lesions progressed, and he experienced phimosis and urinary retention for which he was admitted to a hospital 4 weeks after his rash began. A lesion swab taken the day of admission tested positive for Monkeypox virus (MPXV) DNA by PCR. The patient was discharged with a urinary catheter and 14 days of oral tecovirimat (Supplementary Figure 1; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121838). His skin lesions initially improved, but then spread, coalesced, and developed central necrosis (Figure) (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121835). A suprapubic catheter was placed because of continued need for urinary catheterization. Approximately 10 days after discharge, the patient was readmitted with malaise, poor appetite, weight loss, and new hand and penile lesions. During a 15-day hospitalization, the patient was found to have methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. He was transferred to ICU because of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. In ICU he was treated with intravenous tecovirimat, 2 doses of VIGIV, and antimicrobials. Conjunctivitis developed and was treated with trifluridine and antibacterial eye drops. The patient was discharged on oral tecovirimat and ART and with a suprapubic catheter. During week 7 of oral tecovirimat, he was readmitted because of progressive necrotic lesions with bacterial superinfection on the left hand, left eyelid lesions with periorbital swelling, and a right ear canal lesion associated with drainage and decreased hearing. He was restarted on intravenous tecovirimat and continues this treatment as of this report. 

Patient C. In July 2022, a non-Hispanic White man in his 40s with AIDS (CD4 <10 cells/mm3) and not receiving ART was evaluated for a rash on his face, torso, hands, feet, and perianal area; lesion swabs tested positive for MPXV DNA by PCR. He was admitted to a hospital for pain control and received oral tecovirimat and ART. The patient experienced pain relief and was discharged after 7 days to complete 14 days of tecovirimat. However, his housing and food situations were unstable, and absorption of oral tecovirimat is dependent on concurrent intake of a full, fatty meal. Approximately 3 weeks after discharge, he was readmitted with coalescing, painful, and necrotic lesions on his hands and feet. Despite treatment with oral and intravenous tecovirimat for >4 weeks, 2 doses of cidofovir, 1 dose of VIGIV, and multiple antibiotics, progressive tissue necrosis led to debridement of the soft tissues of the right index finger and amputation of the right fourth toe. Gradually, the monkeypox lesions regressed. He was discharged but was readmitted 1 week later for unresolved lesions and severe pain. He received a second dose of VIGIV and remains hospitalized on oral tecovirimat and ART as of this report. 

","Although most monkeypox cases during the ongoing outbreak have been self-limited (2,8), this report highlights the occurrence of severe manifestations of monkeypox in the United States, particularly in persons with AIDS. In this cohort of patients hospitalized with monkeypox and for whom clinicians or jurisdictions sought consultations with CDC, nearly one third (30%) received ICU-level care, and 21% of patients died, including several deaths that remain under investigation to determine the cause of death. Most patients eventually received tecovirimat, but some experienced delays of up to 4 weeks between initial care-seeking for monkeypox symptoms and initiation of monkeypox-directed therapy. For patients with suspected or laboratory-diagnosed monkeypox who are at risk for severe disease (particularly those with AIDS and other types of severe immunocompromise), health care providers should consider starting monkeypox-directed therapy early, potentially before receipt of monkeypox testing results or before severe manifestations are observed. In patients with severe disease, or with ongoing disease despite treatment, providers should consider extending tecovirimat treatment beyond 14 days and escalating therapy to include cidofovir or VIGIV if clinically indicated (9). For patients with HIV disease who are not on ART, clinicians should initiate ART as soon as possible, regardless of CD4 cell count.**** Health care providers should test all sexually active patients with suspected monkeypox for HIV at the time of testing for monkeypox unless a patient is already known to have HIV infection. 

Most patients in this cohort were Black men, and nearly one quarter of cases occurred in persons experiencing homelessness. These findings likely reflect inequities in access to resources for the prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of HIV infection, as well as missed opportunities to engage groups that have been socially or economically marginalized.†††† Public health outreach should strive to engage all persons with HIV infection in care and to increase access to monkeypox vaccination, diagnosis, and treatment. To accomplish these goals, it is critical to leverage existing HIV and sexually transmitted infection program resources and prioritize communities disproportionately affected by HIV (1). Collaboration with homeless services providers can help engage persons who are experiencing homelessness in prevention and treatment services for HIV and monkeypox. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, cases were passively identified by CDC through consultations requested by clinicians or jurisdictions and might not be representative of all patients with severe monkeypox. Second, this report only included outcomes occurring during the study period; therefore, deaths occurring after this period were not included. Third, observed morbidity and mortality might have been related to factors apart from or in addition to monkeypox, including HIV-related opportunistic infections. Finally, conclusions about the effectiveness of monkeypox treatments cannot be inferred from these observational data. 

The occurrence of severe manifestations of monkeypox in patients who were most commonly immunocompromised because of AIDS highlights the importance of engaging all persons with HIV in sustained care and ending the HIV epidemic. Clinicians should consider close clinical monitoring, early treatment with available medical countermeasures, and extension or escalation of therapy as indicated in patients with or at risk for severe monkeypox. Ensuring equitable access to resources for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of HIV and monkeypox remains a vital public health priority.","Corresponding author: Maureen J.

In July 2022, a case of paralytic poliomyelitis was confirmed in an unvaccinated adult Rockland County, New York resident; environmental sampling found evidence of poliovirus transmission. 

What is added by this report? 

Wastewater testing has identified circulating polioviruses genetically related to virus isolated from the Rockland County patient in at least five New York counties. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Public health efforts to prevent polio should focus on improving coverage with inactivated polio vaccine. Although most persons in the United States are sufficiently immunized, unvaccinated or undervaccinated persons living or working in Kings, Orange, Queens, Rockland, or Sullivan counties, New York should complete the polio vaccination series to prevent additional paralytic cases and curtail transmission.

In July 2022, a case of paralytic poliomyelitis resulting from infection with vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) type 2 (VDPV2)§ was confirmed in an unvaccinated adult resident of Rockland County, New York (1). As of August 10, 2022, poliovirus type 2 (PV2)¶ genetically linked to this VDPV2 had been detected in wastewater** in Rockland County and neighboring Orange County (1). This report describes the results of additional poliovirus testing of wastewater samples collected during March 9–October 11, 2022, and tested as of October 20, 2022, from 48 sewersheds (the community area served by a wastewater collection system) serving parts of Rockland County and 12 surrounding counties. Among 1,076 wastewater samples collected, 89 (8.3%) from 10 sewersheds tested positive for PV2. As part of a broad epidemiologic investigation, wastewater testing can provide information about where poliovirus might be circulating in a community in which a paralytic case has been identified; however, the most important public health actions for preventing paralytic poliomyelitis in the United States remain ongoing case detection through national acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) surveillance†† and improving vaccination coverage in undervaccinated communities. Although most persons in the United States are sufficiently immunized, unvaccinated or undervaccinated persons living or working in Kings, Orange, Queens, Rockland, or Sullivan counties, New York should complete the polio vaccination series as soon as possible. 

High rates of poliovirus vaccination coverage (2) resulted in the elimination of paralytic polio caused by wild-type poliovirus in the United States in 1979.§§ Only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used in the United States since 2000; 3 doses of IPV confer 99%–100% protection from paralytic poliomyelitis (3). Some countries still use oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV); advantages to this approach include low cost, ease of use, and high efficacy in stopping outbreaks. However, in rare cases, the live attenuated virus in OPV can regain neurovirulence, circulate in underimmunized populations, and cause paralytic disease. A previous report confirmed that paralysis of the Rockland County patient resulted from infection with VDPV2, and that related viruses had been detected in wastewater collected from Orange and Rockland counties (1). Since then, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH); Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester counties’ health departments; New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH); New York City Department of Environmental Protection; and CDC have expanded poliovirus wastewater testing as part of an emergency response. This report summarizes findings from the more extensive wastewater testing conducted in the New York metropolitan area as part of investigations to understand the extent of poliovirus circulation and to direct polio vaccination efforts. 

Wastewater samples, including some originally collected for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, were collected from a subset of sewersheds during March 9–October 11, 2022. Samples were collected approximately once or twice weekly from each site. Wastewater samples were processed using either ultracentrifugation or polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by nucleic acid extraction. The extracts were forwarded to the Wadsworth Center (part of NYSDOH) or the New York City Public Health Laboratory (part of NYC DOHMH) where they were packaged and shipped to CDC. At CDC, total nucleic acids were screened for the presence of PV2 using the pan-poliovirus real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and positive samples were sequenced (4,5). 

To investigate the number of indeterminate¶¶ results from some of the New York City samples from large sewersheds (those servicing more than 700,000 residents), NYC DOHMH collected additional larger volume (500 mL) wastewater samples from two sewersheds on August 11, one receiving wastewater from parts of New York County, and another with combined wastewater from parts of Kings, New York, and Queens counties (two distinct upstream sub-sewersheds*** were sampled, one feeding only from the New York County area and another feeding from Kings and Queens counties combined). CDC then concentrated virus from the samples using the filtration and elution method, followed by inoculation of concentrates onto susceptible cell lines to isolate polioviruses (6). Cultures exhibiting viral cytopathic effect were screened by real-time RT-PCR to identify polioviruses (4) and sequenced as described. Data presented are from samples collected during March 9–October 11, 2022, and testing conducted through October 20, 2022. 

The 48 sewersheds tested serve parts of 13 counties in New York, with a total population of approximately 11,413,000 persons (7). A total of 1,076 wastewater samples were collected during March 9–October 11, 2022. Among these, 89 (8.3%) samples from 10 sewersheds tested positive for PV2. Of the 82 PV2-positive samples in the state of New York (outside of New York City), 81 (98.8%) sequences from six sewersheds in Nassau, Orange, Rockland, and Sullivan counties were linked to the virus isolated from the Rockland County patient, and the sequencing results for one sample were not adequate to determine whether it was linked to the virus isolated from the patient (Table) (Figure 1) (Figure 2). Of the seven PV2-positive samples in New York City, only one, from a sub-sewershed receiving wastewater from parts of Kings and Queens counties, was linked to the virus isolated from the patient; this sample was from one of the larger-volume samples. The other six PV2-positive New York City samples included one from Kings County that was not genetically linked to the virus isolated from the patient, and five from three different sewersheds serving parts of Kings, New York, and Richmond counties that were inadequate for sequencing. PV2-positive samples genetically linked to the virus isolated from the patient were collected on more than one occasion in Orange (June 13–October 6), Rockland (May 23–October 4), and Sullivan (July 21–October 5) counties. Only a single sample each from Nassau County on August 18 and the sub-sewershed serving parts of Kings and Queens counties on August 11 tested positive for a PV2 linked to virus isolated from the patient. 

In addition to wastewater testing for poliovirus in New York, a multifaceted public health response is underway that includes efforts to enhance case detection and increase vaccination access and demand. Efforts to improve case detection include testing of persons with nonparalytic, nonspecific viral symptoms consistent with poliovirus infection††† and review of syndromic surveillance databases. Strategies to increase vaccination include communication campaigns, community engagement, vaccination clinics, and outreach to providers and patients, focused on communities with the lowest IPV coverage. On August 12, NYSDOH and NYC DOHMH issued a press release and health alert to guide the public and the health care community about the importance of polio vaccination, emphasizing the imperative to protect unvaccinated and undervaccinated children through vaccination.§§§ On September 9, New York declared a state of emergency,¶¶¶ which allowed additional health professionals (including certain emergency medical service providers, midwives, and pharmacists) to administer poliovirus vaccine in the state.","Wastewater testing during March 9–October 11 has detected PV2 genetically linked to the virus isolated from the Rockland County patient in six of 13 New York counties where wastewater was tested. One county (Nassau) had only a single detection, and therefore was not considered to have evidence of a transmission event. Three counties (Orange, Rockland, and Sullivan) had repeated detections over the course of months in one or more sewersheds, suggesting some level of community transmission in these areas. Only a single large-volume wastewater sample collected on August 11 from Kings and Queens counties in New York City tested positive for a PV2 genetically linked to virus isolated from the patient. However, this finding, coupled with the repeated PV2-positive results from the lower volume samples collected from the broader sewershed catchment areas serving parts of Kings, New York, and Queens counties during June 5–September 6 for which sequencing was not possible, suggests that PV2 could be circulating in Kings and Queens counties as well. 

Wastewater testing in conjunction with high-quality AFM surveillance, has helped clarify the scope of the polio outbreak in New York, which indicates community transmission in a five-county area near the only identified symptomatic patient. Some researchers and public health agencies have had interest in expanding wastewater testing for poliovirus beyond the current outbreak area; however, additional effort is needed to understand the limitations and implications of wastewater testing for poliovirus outside the context of a localized emergency response and epidemiologic investigation of a confirmed polio case. The impact of sewershed system design and size on result interpretation needs further characterization. According to the World Health Organization’s guidelines for environmental surveillance of poliovirus circulation,**** sampling sites chosen for testing should represent selected populations at high risk with a source population of 300,000 or fewer persons. Many sewersheds in the United States, including many in New York and New York City have catchments that exceed this number by a factor of five, which could affect reliability or interpretability of results and limit the ability to effectively target interventions. Although sampling upstream sub-sewersheds can sometimes be possible, this activity might not always be feasible to do regularly because of resource and logistical constraints. In addition, monitoring the progress of polio eradication in a population with high IPV coverage is complicated by use of OPV for routine vaccination and outbreak response in other international settings. The live OPV strain can persist in stool for several weeks after vaccination, and detection of these viruses in wastewater does not have the same public health implication as does detection of a VDPV. In addition, standardized methods of testing and virus characterization need to be established if wastewater testing is to become more widespread, because reliable sequencing and careful interpretation are needed to characterize a finding in wastewater as either an OPV strain or a VDPV. Lastly, and most importantly, the public health objectives for wastewater testing for poliovirus should be defined before its application and before the public health response is scaled up beyond the currently implicated communities at risk in New York. Identifying geographies with connections to the patient’s community and persistently low polio vaccination coverage can, even in the absence of wastewater testing, help target vaccination efforts. However, these areas at risk for paralytic polio and poliovirus circulation might be considered for wastewater testing to prioritize or enhance vaccination efforts in the event of poliovirus detections. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, even if only a small number of persons are excreting poliovirus into a given sewershed, virus mixtures in a sample can be difficult to resolve. High-quality sequences are needed to characterize the virus and confirm linkages between viruses. Because the total number of nucleotide differences is small, a single nucleotide change can be critical in confirming a linkage between viruses. Second, defecation by infected persons in counties other than their home county in New York (e.g., where they work or visit, or through which they travel) could result in wastewater detection; hence, isolated detections do not confirm community circulation. Third, wastewater testing does not provide information about communities and facilities that are not served by municipal sewer systems; neither was every sewershed in each county sampled. Fourth, test results indicate detection or nondetection of poliovirus but cannot provide quantitative estimates of the number of persons infected. Finally, negative test results cannot guarantee that a community is free from poliovirus but can be assessed in conjunction with other surveillance approaches. 

At least five New York counties had evidence of a sustained period of community transmission of poliovirus in 2022. Unvaccinated and undervaccinated persons in these areas are at risk for infection and paralytic disease. A robust national AFM surveillance system must be maintained with reporting of any suspected case of AFM to the appropriate public health authorities and collection of stool samples from any person with a suspected case. All U.S. children should receive IPV in accordance with the routine childhood immunization schedule (8). Most adults in the United States were vaccinated as children and are therefore likely to be protected from paralytic polio; however, any unvaccinated or undervaccinated adult or child living or working in Kings, Orange, Queens, Rockland, or Sullivan counties, New York should complete the IPV series now (9).

Influenza transmission has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

What is added by this report? 

In 2022, influenza A(H3N2) virus, clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2, circulated in Chile months earlier than during prepandemic influenza seasons and was associated with 1,002 hospitalizations. Influenza vaccination reduced risk for A(H3N2) virus hospitalization by 49%. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Like certain Southern Hemisphere countries during the 2022 influenza season, Northern Hemisphere countries might face influenza activity with atypical timing and intensity during the 2022–23 season. Health authorities should encourage all eligible persons to seek influenza vaccination and take precautions to reduce transmission of influenza (e.g., avoiding close contact with persons who are ill).

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected influenza virus transmission, with historically low activity, atypical timing, or altered duration of influenza seasons during 2020–22 (1,2). Community mitigation measures implemented since 2020, including physical distancing and face mask use, have, in part, been credited for low influenza detections globally during the pandemic, compared with those during prepandemic seasons (1). Reduced population exposure to natural influenza infections during 2020–21 and relaxed community mitigation measures after introduction of COVID-19 vaccines could increase the possibility of severe influenza epidemics. Partners in Chile and the United States assessed Southern Hemisphere influenza activity and estimated age-group–specific rates of influenza-attributable hospitalizations and vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Chile in 2022. Chile’s most recent influenza season began in January 2022, which was earlier than during prepandemic seasons and was associated predominantly with influenza A(H3N2) virus, clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. The cumulative incidence of influenza-attributable pneumonia and influenza (P&I) hospitalizations was 5.1 per 100,000 person-years during 2022, which was higher than that during 2020–21 but lower than incidence during the 2017–19 influenza seasons. Adjusted VE against influenza A(H3N2)-associated hospitalization was 49%. These findings indicate that influenza activity continues to be disrupted after emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. Northern Hemisphere countries might benefit from preparing for an atypical influenza season, which could include early influenza activity with potentially severe disease during the 2022–23 season, especially in the absence of prevention measures, including vaccination. Health authorities should encourage all eligible persons to seek influenza vaccination and take precautions to reduce transmission of influenza (e.g., avoiding close contact with persons who are ill). 

Influenza incidence was estimated using Chile’s Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud [MINSAL]) Department of Statistics and Health Information hospital discharge data and viral surveillance data from the National Influenza Centre (NIC). Chile registers all public and private hospital patient discharge diagnoses in a central data set. A subset of respiratory specimens from these patients was tested using CDC reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols† for influenza virus during routine clinical care or as part of national respiratory virus surveillance. The epidemic threshold used to delineate the influenza season was defined as the mean of weekly percentage of positive specimens tested through NIC during 2017–19. The start of the influenza season for each calendar year during 2017–19 and in 2022 was defined as the epidemiologic week during which the percentage of influenza-positive specimens had exceeded the historical epidemic threshold for ≥3 weeks. Previously described methods (3) were used to estimate cumulative incidence of influenza hospitalization. Only certain International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) P&I discharge diagnosis codes (J09–18) were considered to be attributable to influenza viruses because providers typically make these diagnoses in the absence of laboratory testing. To attribute P&I diagnoses to influenza, the percentage of patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) enrolled from nine sentinel sites§ with influenza-positive specimens tested at NIC was applied to untested patients with a P&I diagnosis. The percentage of SARI patients with an influenza-positive specimen was calculated for each month and for each age group (<5, 5–18, 19–64, and ≥65 years). A similar proportion of persons with P&I diagnoses were assumed to have a positive influenza test result (Supplementary Table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121863). To minimize misclassification, only cases for which P&I was the principal diagnosis associated with hospitalization were included in calculations estimating the influenza-attributable proportion of P&I cases. The age group–specific proportion was calculated by age group and by month, totaled for each age group, divided by the number of persons in that age group for that year, and then multiplied by 100,000 to derive incidence per 100,000 person-years. 

In 2022, Chile used Abbott INFLUVAC, a Southern Hemisphere, trivalent egg-based influenza vaccine formulation containing antigens from an A/Victoria/2570/2019 (H1N1)pdm09–like virus, A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)–like virus, and B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)–like virus (4). SARI sentinel data submitted to the Pan American Health Organization’s Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean — influenza (REVELAC-i ) were used to estimate this vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing influenza hospitalizations using previously described methods (5). REVELAC-i used a test-negative, case-control design to determine the likelihood that a hospitalized patient with severe respiratory infection and a positive influenza test result (case-patient) had been previously vaccinated against influenza compared with the odds that a patient hospitalized with a similar illness, but with a negative influenza test result (control-patient), had been vaccinated. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results were excluded from the control group (6). VE estimates were calculated as 1 − odds ratio x 100 and adjusted for age, month of symptom onset, and preexisting conditions. This report was reviewed by MINSAL and conducted consistent with relevant laws.¶ This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.** 

During 2022, Chile’s NIC tested 59,392 respiratory specimens through its national laboratory network, 3,140 (5.3%) of which were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 4,070 (6.9%) of which were positive for influenza. Among influenza-positive specimens, 2,204 (54%) were typed, and all but one (2,203; >99.9%) were influenza A(H3N2) virus; the remaining one specimen was an influenza A(H1N1) virus. During 2017, 2018, and 2019, the influenza epidemic threshold was 6.2%, and the start of influenza season occurred during weeks 18, 21, and 17, respectively, corresponding to an influenza season beginning during April–May. In contrast, in 2022, the percentage of influenza-positive specimens first surpassed and remained above this epidemic threshold during weeks 1–6 (January–February), was below the epidemic threshold during weeks 7–17, and then surpassed it again starting in week 18 (May); peak activity was during week 24 (June) (Figure). All 280 (12.7%) influenza virus specimens sequenced by next-generation sequencing were influenza A(H3N2), clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. 

During January–August 2022, a total of 17,752 (0.1%) persons in Chile’s population (19,828,563) were hospitalized for treatment of P&I; among these patients, 4,911 (27.7%) were aged <5 years, 929 (5.2%) were aged 5–18 years, 3,342 (18.8%) were aged 19–64 years, and 8,570 (48.3%) were aged ≥65 years (Table). A total of 6,025 SARI patients were enrolled at nine Chile sentinel surveillance sites in 2022. Among these, respiratory specimens from 5,731 (95.1%) patients were tested by RT-PCR; 301 (5.3%) of these were positive for influenza virus. 

Overall, 1,002 (5.6%) of 17,752 P&I hospitalizations were attributable to influenza; among these, 132 (12.8%) were among persons aged <5 years, 79 (7.6%) were among persons aged 5–18 years, 302 (29.2%) were among adults aged 19–64 years, and 521 (50.4%) were among adults aged ≥65 years.†† The cumulative incidence of influenza-attributable P&I hospitalizations during weeks 1–32 was 5.1 per 100,000 person-years during 2022. The highest incidence (20.3 per 100,000 person-years) was among adults aged ≥65 years. Among persons aged <5 years, 5–18 years, and 19–64 years, incidences were 11.2, 2.2, and 2.4, respectively. Incidence of influenza-attributable P&I hospitalizations during 2022 was substantially higher than that in 2021 (0.01) and 2020 (0.6), but substantially lower than that in 2017 (28.7), 2018 (23.0), and 2019 (30.4). 

Among persons prioritized to receive influenza vaccination in Chile during 2022 (adults aged ≥65 years, persons aged 11–64 years with chronic conditions, pregnant women, infants and children aged 6 months–10 years, and certain other persons§§) who accounted for 41% of the total population, 92.5% were vaccinated. Although 2022 Southern Hemisphere formulation vaccines were not available before the first unseasonal influenza wave during weeks 1–6, approximately 88% of vaccinated persons received their vaccine before the peak of 2022 influenza activity in week 24. 

Sentinel surveillance data submitted to REVELAC-i used to estimate VE for Chile included 717 test-negative control-patients and 175 case-patients. Among 175 case-patients, 118 (67%) received a positive test result for A(H3N2) virus, and one received a positive test result for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The crude and adjusted estimates of VE against influenza A(H3N2)-associated hospitalization were 46% (95% CI = 17%–65%) and 49% (95% CI = 23%–67%), respectively. 

","The influenza epidemic in Chile during 2022 began months earlier than in a typical influenza season (7) and resulted in 1,002 influenza-associated P&I hospitalizations. Whereas 2022 incidence of influenza-associated hospitalization was four to six times lower than during 2017–19 pre–COVID-19 pandemic seasons, it was much higher than incidence in 2020–21 when influenza virus detection in Chile was low. Chile’s influenza activity in 2022, including an early unseasonal start and A(H3N2) virus predominance, was consistent with trends in other countries in the Southern Hemisphere in 2022, including Australia, Argentina, and Peru; the start of South Africa’s influenza seasons was consistent with prepandemic seasons and was characterized by an initial predominance of A(H1N1)pdm09, followed by B/Victoria viruses.¶¶ 

To reduce influenza-associated morbidity, the government of Chile vaccinated >90% of persons prioritized for vaccination free of charge. Although these vaccines only became available after the first influenza wave (weeks 1–6), Chilean health authorities successfully vaccinated 88% of the target population before peak influenza activity in week 24. Influenza vaccines were 49% effective at preventing hospitalizations during this predominantly A(H3N2) clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 season. The Northern Hemisphere 2022–23 influenza vaccine formulation contains the same A(H3N2) clade and antigen (3C.2a1b.2a.2 and A/Darwin/9/2021, respectively) used in the 2022 Southern Hemisphere vaccine; if the A(H3N2) clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 also predominates during 2022–23 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, this Northern Hemisphere formulation might be similarly effective at preventing severe influenza illnesses. Like certain Southern Hemisphere jurisdictions, Chile identified a limited number of influenza B virus cases, none of which was subtyped as B/Yamagata. The global absence of B/Yamagata might indicate that this subtype has become rare (8); however, continued surveillance is needed to learn whether it will reemerge in future seasons. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the dominant circulating subtype was determined based on the typing of 54% (2,204 of 4,070) of respiratory specimens that tested positive for influenza virus, and the dominant clade was determined from sequencing 13% of specimens (280 of 2,203); thus, it is possible that other virus types and clades were not identified. Second, VE estimates are based on a limited number of hospitalized case-patients and control-patients from nine hospitals, and unmeasured confounding, including confounding associated with hospitalization or vaccination, might be present in this data set. Finally, testing and hospitalization data could have been affected by changes in health care–seeking behavior because of the COVID-19 pandemic which was not assessed in these analyses. 

These data from Chile’s 2022 influenza season indicate that influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere was atypical, likely because of continued effects of emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. Strict observance of community mitigation measures (9) and high influenza vaccination coverage likely mitigated influenza incidence in Chile during the 2022 season. Northern Hemisphere countries could benefit from preparing for an atypical season, which could include early influenza activity with potentially severe disease for the 2022–23 season, especially in the absence of prevention measures, including vaccination. Health officials should encourage communities to protect themselves by seeking influenza vaccination in accordance with CDC recommendations and taking precautions to reduce transmission of influenza, including avoiding close contact with persons who are ill (10).","Corresponding authors: Rodrigo A.

Outpatient medications are effective at preventing severe COVID-19 and are important to pandemic mitigation. Paxlovid is the most commonly prescribed medication and the preferred outpatient therapeutic for eligible patients. 

What is added by this report? 

Racial and ethnic disparities persisted in outpatient COVID-19 treatment through July 2022. During April–July 2022, the percentage of COVID-19 patients aged ≥20 years treated with Paxlovid was 36% and 30% lower among Black and Hispanic patients than among White and non-Hispanic patients, respectively. These disparities existed among all age groups and patients with immunocompromise. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Expansion of programs to increase awareness of and access to available outpatient COVID-19 treatments can help protect persons at high risk for severe illness and facilitate equitable health outcomes.

In December 2021 and early 2022, four medications received emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration for outpatient treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients who are at high risk for progressing to severe disease; these included nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) and molnupiravir (Lagevrio) (both oral antivirals), expanded use of remdesivir (Veklury; an intraveneous antiviral), and bebtelovimab (a monoclonal antibody [mAb]).* Reports have documented disparities in mAb treatment by race and ethnicity (1) and in oral antiviral treatment by zip code–level social vulnerability (2); however, limited data are available on racial and ethnic disparities in oral antiviral treatment.† Using electronic health record (EHR) data from 692,570 COVID-19 patients aged ≥20 years who sought medical care during January–July 2022, treatment with Paxlovid, Lagevrio, Veklury, and mAbs was assessed by race and ethnicity, overall and among high-risk patient groups. During 2022, the percentage of COVID-19 patients seeking medical care who were treated with Paxlovid increased from 0.6% in January to 20.2% in April and 34.3% in July; the other three medications were used less frequently (0.7%–5.0% in July). During April–July 2022, when Paxlovid use was highest, compared with White patients, Black or African American (Black) patients were prescribed Paxlovid 35.8% less often, multiple or other race patients 24.9% less often, American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (AIAN/NHOPI) patients 23.1% less often, and Asian patients 19.4% less often; Hispanic patients were prescribed Paxlovid 29.9% less often than non-Hispanic patients. Racial and ethnic disparities in Paxlovid treatment were generally somewhat higher among patients at high risk for severe COVID-19, including those aged ≥50 years and those who were immunocompromised. The expansion of programs focused on equitable awareness of and access to outpatient COVID-19 treatments, as well as COVID-19 vaccination, including updated bivalent booster doses, can help protect persons most at risk for severe illness and facilitate equitable health outcomes. 

This study used EHR data from 30 sites (each representing one or more health care systems) participating in PCORnet, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet).§ The PCORnet distributed data infrastructure was queried¶ and returned aggregate demographic and clinical data for all COVID-19 patients and those treated with Paxlovid, Lagevrio, Veklury,** or mAbs†† during January–July 2022. COVID-19 patients were persons aged ≥20 years who sought medical care and had EHR documentation of a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test result, an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnostic code for COVID-19 (U07.1 and U07.2), or treatment with an assessed COVID-19 medication.§§ Treated COVID-19 patients had EHR documentation of a Paxlovid or Lagevrio prescription or Veklury or mAb administration.¶¶ High-risk patient groups were defined based on age (50–64, 65–79, and ≥80 years) and immunocompromise (previous organ transplant, active cancer treatment, corticosteroid use, and immunosuppressive medication use).*** 

The percentage of COVID-19 patients treated with each medication was calculated by age group, sex (male and female), race (White, Black, Asian, AIAN/NHOPI, multiple or other race, and missing), ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic, and other or missing),††† immunocompromise, and underlying medical conditions.§§§ Disparities were assessed using absolute differences (percentage treated in the racial or ethnic minority group minus the percentage treated in the majority group [i.e., White race and non-Hispanic ethnicity, respectively]) and relative differences (absolute difference divided by the percentage treated in the majority group). Statistical differences in the percentage treated by race and ethnicity were quantified using Pearson’s chi-square tests comparing patients in the minority groups with those in the majority group. Disparities in percentage treated overall and by age group were assessed during April–July 2022, when Paxlovid use was highest; disparities by immunocompromise could only be assessed during January–July 2022 because of restrictions in the PCORnet distributed data infrastructure. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶¶ 

During January–July 2022, a total of 692,570 COVID-19 patients aged ≥20 years were identified.**** Among these, 22.2% were aged ≥65 years, 60.5% were female, 68.2% were White, and 79.6% were non-Hispanic (Table 1). Overall, 11.7% of COVID-19 patients were treated with Paxlovid, 2.7% with mAbs, 1.0% with Lagevrio, and 0.7% with Veklury. The percentage treated with Paxlovid exceeded the overall average of 11.7% for the following patient groups: aged ≥50 years, White, non-Hispanic,†††† active cancer treatment, corticosteroid use, immunosuppressive medication use, and presence of underlying medical conditions (except chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, and dementia). mAb treatment was more common than Paxlovid treatment among patients with a previous organ transplant. 

During 2022, the percentage of COVID-19 patients treated with Paxlovid increased from 0.6% in January to 20.2% in April and 34.0% in July (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121864). Treatment with other medications occurred less frequently and varied less during the study period (mAbs [monthly range = 1.2%–5.0%], Lagevrio [0.4%–2.5%], and Veklury [0.6%–0.9%]). Racial and ethnic differences in monthly Paxlovid treatment were observed (Figure). 

During April–July 2022, Paxlovid treatment among adults aged ≥20 years was 35.8% lower among Black patients (20.5% treated) than it was among White patients (31.9% treated) (Table 2). Paxlovid treatment was 24.9%, 23.1%, and 19.4% lower among multiple or other race, AIAN/NHOPI, and Asian patients, respectively, than among White patients, and 29.9% lower among Hispanic than among non-Hispanic patients. In age-stratified analyses, the percentage of patients aged 20–49, 50–64, 65–79, and ≥80 years who were prescribed Paxlovid was 20.9%, 34.3%, 39.9%, and 30.7%, respectively. Disparities for Black, multiple or other race, and Hispanic patients were present across all age strata; the largest relative difference (44.0%) was between Black and White patients aged 65–79 years. 

Racial and ethnic disparities existed for treatment with other medications, but absolute differences were small, given the low treatment percentages. Racial and ethnic minority patients were treated with mAbs and Lagevrio less often than were White and non-Hispanic patients (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121865). AIAN/NHOPI, Asian, and Hispanic patients received Veklury less often than did White and non-Hispanic patients; Black patients received Veklury more often than White patients. 

During January–July 2022, racial and ethnic disparities also existed for the four immunocompromised patient groups. In general, immunocompromised Black, multiple or other race, and Hispanic patients were treated with Paxlovid and mAbs less often than were immunocompromised White and non-Hispanic patients. Treatment differences between immunocompromised White and both AIAN/NHOPI and Asian patients were small or not statistically significant (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121865).","In this study of nearly 700,000 COVID-19 patients who sought medical care, the proportion who were treated with an outpatient COVID-19 medication increased substantially over time, primarily driven by increased Paxlovid use; however, treatment gaps exist among racial and ethnic minority groups. During April–July 2022, Paxlovid treatment was 35.8% lower among Black patients relative to White patients and 29.9% lower among Hispanic patients relative to non-Hispanic patients. This study corroborates previous reports of inequitable outpatient COVID-19 treatment (1,2) and documents the persistence of racial and ethnic disparities through July 2022. Disparities in pharmacy dispensing of oral antiviral medications between zip codes with high and with low social vulnerability began narrowing during July–August 2022, after the current study ended (3). Additional analyses can determine whether this recent ecological trend will result in reduced racial and ethnic disparities. 

Multiple factors likely contributed to the observed disparities. Persons living in counties that are both high-poverty areas and majority Black, Hispanic, or American Indian or Alaska Native are less likely to have access to COVID-19 treatment facilities.§§§§ Limited access to treatment is particularly detrimental when patients need timely services, as is required for COVID-19 medications that must be initiated soon after symptom onset (5 days for oral antivirals, 7 days for mAbs and Veklury, as authorized by EUAs). In addition, minority patients’ previous negative experiences with health care services could influence their decisions regarding use of treatments (4), or racism and implicit biases among health care providers might have contributed to treatment disparities (5). Race and ethnicity also could be proxies for other barriers, such as limited knowledge of treatment options, lack of internet access for telemedicine services (6), limited transportation, and language barriers (7). 

Lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic¶¶¶¶ offer opportunities to reduce outpatient treatment disparities (8), including prioritizing medication distribution to and raising awareness about treatment options among local health care providers and members of disproportionately affected communities. Communication campaigns, especially those that use trusted messengers, have been effective in reaching racial and ethnic minority populations and might facilitate increased awareness and use of COVID-19 treatments (9). Several initiatives have been implemented at the federal and state levels to improve equitable dispensing of COVID-19 medications (3). One example is the federal Test-to-Treat initiative that provides COVID-19 testing, medical evaluation, and treatment at a single location and was expanded in May 2022 to better reach vulnerable communities.***** 

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, the aggregate data structure did not allow for adjustment of demographic or clinical factors that might be correlated with race and ethnicity or for assessment of combined race and ethnicity over time. Second, this study assessed treatment disparities among COVID-19 patients who sought medical care; the percentage treated and magnitude of disparities among COVID-19 patients who are eligible for treatment or among all persons with COVID-19 is unknown. Third, patients treated with oral antiviral medications at community treatment programs (e.g., Test-to-Treat) were not captured in this study; thus, actual disparities could be lower than those reported if community treatment programs were differentially used by racial and ethnic minority groups. Fourth, the reasons for nontreatment (e.g., too long since symptom onset, not at risk for severe illness, treatment not offered, or treatment refused) are unknown. Fifth, small sample sizes for some race and immunocompromised patient groups led to unstable estimates. Finally, PCORnet data are derived from a convenience sample of health care facilities and captured approximately 2% of COVID-19 patients reported to CDC during January–July 2022; thus, the results might not be nationally generalizable. 

Early access to effective COVID-19 treatments and staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including use of updated bivalent boosters,††††† are critical components of the public health response to the pandemic, especially for protecting persons most at risk for severe illness (10). Racial and ethnic disparities persist in outpatient COVID-19 treatment, even among older adults and patients with immunocompromise. Expansion of programs focused on equitable outpatient COVID-19 treatment, including raising patient awareness using trusted sources, educating clinicians and other prescribers, and expanding patient access to prescribers, can facilitate equitable health outcomes.","Corresponding author: Tegan K.

As of September 28, 2022, Georgia had reported 1,784 monkeypox cases; 98% of which occurred in males and 77% among Black persons (2). As of September 13, 2022, 60% of reported cases were among persons with HIV infection, and 50% of persons with monkeypox had a sexually transmitted infection within the past year (3). Because of racial disparities in the incidence of monkeypox cases and a large proportion of cases among MSM in Georgia, early vaccination beginning in July focused on improving equitable access by establishing new and leveraging existing partnerships with community-based organizations that serve affected populations, including persons with HIV infection. Despite these efforts, disparities persisted because of high demand and limited vaccine supply. The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) requested CDC support for a vaccine pilot and received an additional allocation of 5,500 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine for administration at events leading up to and throughout a Black gay Pride festival in Atlanta, a multiday event held Labor Day weekend (September 2–5, 2022). The event celebrates lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual, and other (LGBTQIA+) communities of color and hosts more than 125,000 attendees each year. Before the festival (as of August 24), 17,546 persons had been vaccinated in Georgia, of whom 96% were male, 34% aged 25–36 years, 44% Black, and 8% Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (4). 

During August 27–September 5, Georgia DPH, in conjunction with metropolitan Atlanta local public health departments in five counties† and local community-based organizations, administered the additional allocation of JYNNEOS vaccine. Vaccination events held before the festival (August 27–September 1) were located at local health department clinics and at venues acceptable and convenient for Black MSM, such as familiar large event spaces, bars, and clubs. During the festival (September 2–5), vaccine events were held during the day and after hours at health department clinics and at bars and clubs via mobile vans to increase broad reach and access. Georgia DPH staff members used social media, community-based organizations, and field outreach to promote vaccination events. Vaccines were administered by Georgia DPH, partner organizations, and local health departments. Patient demographic data were collected at the time of vaccination and entered into the Georgia Immunization Registry. Aggregate data were shared with CDC. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§ 

During August 27–September 5, a total of 4,282 JYNNEOS vaccine doses (78% of the additional allocation) were administered. Two thirds (2,874) of doses were administered before the festival and one third (1,408) during the event. Overall, 2,886 (67%) doses were administered at 22 routine vaccination events at health department clinics, 702 (16%) doses at 20 mobile, community pop-up events, and 694 (16%) doses at one fixed location (a Georgia DPH-sponsored mass vaccination event). Among vaccine recipients, 93% were male, 55% were aged 30–49 years, 48% were Black, and 8% were Hispanic (Table). The proportion of Black persons receiving vaccine was higher during the festival (53%) than before the event (46%), but the proportion of Hispanic recipients was similar (7% versus 8%). Nearly one third (31%) of records were missing data on state of residence. 

Vaccinating communities disproportionately affected by the monkeypox outbreak is important in stopping spread of Monkeypox virus and ending the outbreak (5). A community-based approach by a coalition of festival organizers, government entities, and LGBTQIA+ community advocates was successful at improving equitable monkeypox vaccination. This work highlights the value of health department and community-based organization in-person and virtual outreach to increase health equity. Challenges to an equitable approach to monkeypox vaccination included decreasing trends in vaccine demand by the time of the event (possibly attributable to historical vaccine hesitancy or stigma), ensuring second doses for out-of-state travelers, and recent concerns about receiving second doses because of skin discoloration associated with intradermal vaccine administration.¶ Georgia DPH is implementing additional events to help ensure that persons in Georgia receive their second JYNNEOS vaccine dose. As the vaccine supply increases, distribution strategies should continue to focus on eliminating disparities and removing barriers, especially for persons who might be hesitant to be vaccinated or uncomfortable being vaccinated at a large event.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Damian J.

Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) represent the most affected demographic group in the current multinational outbreak (2). As of October 18, 2022, Louisiana had reported 273 monkeypox cases with 187 (68.5%) among residents of the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) Southeast Region, which includes the city of New Orleans (3). 

Southern Decadence is an annual multiday festival in New Orleans catering to persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex, asexual, and others (LGBTQIA+) that draws 150,000–300,000 participants annually. To prepare for the 2022 festival (September 1–5), LDH requested CDC collaboration for preparedness planning, including statewide pre-event administration of JYNNEOS vaccine to prevent monkeypox. CDC helped acquire 1,500 vials (≤6,000 intradermal doses) of JYNNEOS vaccine through a federal monkeypox large event vaccine pilot in addition to the state’s Phase 3 allocation of 4,400 doses.* Concurrently, LDH staff members used multiple strategies to reach out to the LGBTQIA+ community to provide education and increase vaccination coverage among eligible persons, based on local vaccination eligibility criteria (3). 

Vaccination was available free of charge through public and private health clinics (clinics) beginning in July 2022.† As part of the state’s prevention strategy to increase vaccination among eligible Louisiana residents in advance of Southern Decadence, LDH hosted a series of community vaccination events, including large volume events in central locations and smaller, more focused events. The smaller events, organized in collaboration with community partners, were aimed at removing barriers (e.g., stigma and mistrust) and reducing disparities by reaching populations at highest risk, especially persons with limited access to medical care. These community vaccination events were held across the state before and during the festival (August 9–September 5, 2022). Vaccination venues were purposefully selected at locations where MSM would feel comfortable seeking vaccination, such as gay-owned or gay-frequented venues. Patient demographic information was collected at the time of vaccination by the LDH Immunization Program. Aggregate data were shared with CDC. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§ 

More than one half (58.6%) of Louisiana monkeypox cases have occurred among persons who identify as non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) (3). Selection of community vaccination venues included a focus on gay bars and clubs with primarily Black patrons to help ensure more equitable access to vaccines. Community vaccination efforts continued during Southern Decadence and were held daily in a central venue (the Health Hub) three blocks from the main festival area. The Health Hub offered vaccines and testing for monkeypox and COVID-19, HIV screening, condoms, safe injection kits, fentanyl test strips, naloxone, and other health resources. 

During August 9–September 5, 2022, a total of 6,854 doses of JYNNEOS were administered in Louisiana (Table), with 53.0%, 34.8%, and 12.2% administered at clinics, non–Health Hub community vaccination events, and the Health Hub, respectively.¶ Among persons who received vaccine outside the Health Hub, 90.1% were Louisiana residents; 54%, 24.0%, and 6.7% were non-Hispanic White (White), Black, and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons, respectively. Among Health Hub vaccine recipients, 45.5% were Louisiana residents, and 52.3%, 13.9%, and 10.3% were White, Black, and Hispanic persons, respectively. Residents of California, Florida, New York, and Texas accounted for 26.0% of Health Hub vaccine recipients. 

Achieving vaccine equity among communities disproportionately affected by the outbreak is critical to stopping the spread of Monkeypox virus (4). Large LGBTQIA+ gatherings that attract substantial media and social media attention, such as Southern Decadence, provide an opportunity to build vaccine demand among local members of the LGBTQIA+ community through outreach regarding the importance of vaccination, engagement of racial and ethnic minority groups, and stimulation of pre-event local vaccination efforts. Community-based monkeypox vaccination events can provide an accessible safe space for vaccination while minimizing judgment and stigma. Increased availability of vaccines ahead of the festival, including at clinics and community vaccination events, and during the festival at the Health Hub, increased overall vaccine access while reaching different demographic groups. Vaccinations at non–Health Hub settings more frequently reached Louisiana residents who identified as racial and ethnic minorities, whereas vaccination at the Health Hub increased reach to residents of other states. Although vaccination has not reached parity with racial and ethnic case distribution, the percentage of vaccine recipients who identified as Black at non–Health Hub settings (24.0%) was higher than that before August 9 (16.0%)** and at the Health Hub (13.9%). These data suggest that community engagement, targeted messaging, and selection of venues catering primarily to racial and ethnic minorities for community vaccination events can improve vaccine equity and reduce health disparities.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Rieza H.

In the United States, JYNNEOS vaccine is recommended for persons exposed to or at high risk for exposure to Monkeypox virus. 

What is added by this report? 

By October 10, 2022, a total of 931,155 JYNNEOS vaccine doses were administered in the United States. Among persons who received ≥1 vaccine dose, 51.4% were non-Hispanic White, 12.6% were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), and 22.5% were Hispanic persons. The percentages of vaccine recipients who were Black (5.6%) and Hispanic (15.5%) during May 22–June 25 increased to 13.3% and 22.7%, respectively, during July 31–October 10. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Tracking and addressing disparities in vaccination can reduce inequities and help ensure that disproportionately affected populations are protected.

Vaccination with JYNNEOS vaccine (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic) to prevent monkeypox commenced shortly after confirmation of the first monkeypox case in the current outbreak in the United States on May 17, 2022 (1). To date, more than 27,000 cases have been reported across all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico.* JYNNEOS vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a 0.5-mL 2-dose series administered subcutaneously 28 days apart to prevent smallpox and monkeypox infections (2) and has been found to provide protection against monkeypox infection during the current outbreak (3). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) allocated 1.1 million vials of JYNNEOS vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile, with doses allocated to jurisdictions based on case counts and estimated size of population at risk (4). However, initial vaccine supplies were severely constrained relative to vaccine demand during the expanding outbreak. Some jurisdictions with highest incidence responded by prioritizing first dose administration during May–July (5,6). The FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) of 0.1 mL dosing for intradermal administration of JYNNEOS for persons aged ≥18 years on August 9, 2022, substantially expanded available vaccine supply† (7). The U.S. vaccination strategy focuses primarily on persons with known or presumed exposures to monkeypox (8) or those at high risk for occupational exposure (9). Data on monkeypox vaccine doses administered and reported to CDC by U.S. jurisdictions were analyzed to assess vaccine administration and completion of the 2-dose series. A total of 931,155 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine were administered and reported to the CDC by 55 U.S. jurisdictions during May 22–October 10, 2022. Among persons who received ≥1 dose, 51.4% were non-Hispanic White (White), 22.5% were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), and 12.6% were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black). The percentages of vaccine recipients who were Black (5.6%) and Hispanic (15.5%) during May 22–June 25 increased to 13.3% and 22.7%, respectively, during July 31–October 10. Among 496,888 persons who received a first dose and were eligible for a second dose during the study period, 57.6% received their second dose. Second dose receipt was highest among older adults, White persons, and those residing in the South U.S. Census Bureau Region. Tracking and addressing disparities in vaccination can reduce inequities, and equitable access to and acceptance of vaccine should be an essential factor in planning vaccination programs, events, and strategies. Receipt of both first and second doses is necessary for optimal protection against Monkeypox virus infection. 

The system for reporting monkeypox vaccination data was adapted from existing infrastructure and data flow structures developed for reporting COVID-19 vaccine administration data.§ Providers submitted monkeypox vaccination data to their jurisdiction’s immunization information systems (IIS); state, local, and territorial jurisdictions reported vaccine administration data to CDC. Monkeypox vaccine doses administered to persons in 49 states, New York City, Philadelphia, DC, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands during May 22–October 10, 2022, and reported to CDC as of October 12, 2022, were analyzed to assess vaccination by sex, age group, race and ethnicity, U.S. Census Bureau region, and urbanicity.¶ 

The proportion of persons who received a second JYNNEOS vaccine dose was calculated from among all persons who received a first dose and were due for their second dose during the study period.** First and second doses were linked by CDC based on a recipient identifier assigned by the reporting entity and the three-digit reporting entity code.†† The interval in days between first and second doses was calculated using date of administration for each dose. Analyses were conducted using SQL Server Management Studio (version 18; Microsoft) and SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§ 

During May 22–October 10, 2022, a total of 931,155 JYNNEOS vaccine doses were administered and reported to CDC by U.S. jurisdictions, including 628,610 (67.5%) first doses, 301,770 (32.4%) second doses, and 775 (0.1%) third, fourth, or fifth doses.¶¶ Weekly first dose administration peaked at 102,262 during the week August 7–13 (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121818). The majority of vaccine doses (63%) were administered in the six states reporting the highest monkeypox case counts (California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, and Texas).*** 

Among 628,610 persons who received ≥1 dose of vaccine, 91.9% were male, and 65.4% were aged 25–49 years (Table 1). Most vaccine recipients were residents of urban counties (82.5%); 15.9% and 1.6% lived in suburban and rural counties, respectively. Race and ethnicity were reported for 91.0% of vaccinated persons; among those, 51.4% were White, 22.5% were Hispanic, 12.6% were Black, and 7.6% were Asian persons. The percentages of vaccine recipients who were Black (5.6%) and Hispanic (15.5%) during May 22–June 25, increased to 9.4% and 21.9%, respectively, during June 26–July 30, and to 13.3% and 22.7%, respectively, during July 31–October 10 (Figure) (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121816). The most common provider sites where persons received vaccines were public health clinics (41.5%), commercial vaccination service providers (13.6%), medical practices (9.3%), and hospitals (9.1%) (Table 1). 

Among 496,888 first-dose vaccine recipients who were eligible to receive a second dose during the study period, 285,964 (57.6%) had received the second dose as of October 10 (Table 2). Receipt of a second dose was highest in the South (70.0%) and lowest in the Northeast (51.8%). The percentage of persons who received a second dose varied across jurisdictions (range = 22.4%–82.5%) (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121817). In New York City and Philadelphia, where administration of second doses was delayed because of prioritization of first doses (5,6), fewer than one half of first-dose recipients had received a second dose. Second dose receipt was lower among females (39.4%) than among males (59.3%), was highest among White persons (61.4%), was lowest among persons of Hispanic (53.9%) or unknown race or ethnicity (51.2%), and increased with increasing age. More than one half of eligible Black, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander persons received a second dose. Among persons who received a second dose, 68.7% received the dose within the recommended interval of 24–35 days after the first dose (median = 31 days; IQR = 28–38 days) (Table 2).","This report documents the first large-scale effort to provide JYNNEOS vaccine to persons at higher risk for exposure to Monkeypox virus in the United States. More than 900,000 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine were administered during the first 5 months of the vaccination effort, with approximately 628,000 persons receiving ≥1 dose, and 302,000 persons receiving the complete 2-dose series. Although a peak in first dose administration occurred in mid-August, administration of first and second vaccine doses is continuing. More than one half of persons who initiated the vaccination series and were eligible for a second dose during the study period have received their second dose; completion of the second dose is necessary for optimal protection against Monkeypox virus infection. Importantly, there was substantial progress in increasing the proportion of Black and Hispanic persons vaccinated during the more recent period. Increasing the availability of vaccine at community events, including a focus on health equity, has contributed to these improvements. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, it was not possible to assess vaccination based on gender identity because this information is not routinely collected during vaccine administration, and existing IIS systems do not include this variable. Second, race or ethnicity was unknown for 9.0% of persons who received JYNNEOS vaccine, which could limit ability to interpret differences by race and ethnicity. Third, linkage of an individual person’s first and second doses depends on the accuracy of recipient identifiers in a jurisdiction’s IIS. Persons who received their second dose in a different jurisdiction than where they received their first dose might not be able to be linked to their first dose, resulting in an underestimation of second dose receipt. Finally, second-dose status was unknown for 23,264 (3.7%) first-dose recipients who lived in a jurisdiction that did not submit person-level vaccination data; vaccine recipients from this jurisdiction were not included in the analysis of second dose receipt. 

HHS allocated and distributed vaccine doses to prioritize persons at highest risk for exposure to Monkeypox virus and in jurisdictions with the highest case counts and size of priority population. The multiphase allocation and distribution of vaccines was necessary because of initial supply limitations during the period of most rapid epidemic growth. Jurisdictions developed vaccination strategies based on local epidemiology and availability of resources. Early constraints might have limited vaccine access for populations who could not travel long distances, had inflexible work schedules, or could not access online appointment scheduling. Over time, jurisdictions have worked to improve vaccine access, including increasing the number of vaccine events and providers. Many persons with increased risk factors during the current monkeypox outbreak have received ≥1 dose of monkeypox vaccine. However, analysis of the demographic characteristics of persons who have received vaccine indicates that there are certain demographic groups who were less likely to be vaccinated, including Hispanic and Black persons, despite being disproportionately affected by the monkeypox outbreak (10). Monitoring and addressing disparities in vaccine administration can reduce health inequities. CDC’s monkeypox vaccine equity pilot program provides an opportunity to implement and evaluate novel strategies to reach populations most affected by the monkeypox outbreak but who might face barriers to getting vaccinated.††† Equitable access to and acceptance of vaccine should be an essential factor in planning vaccination programs, events, and strategies. Receipt of both first and second doses is necessary for optimal protection against Monkeypox virus infection. Improving equity in vaccination for both first and second doses is important to protect persons who are most at risk and to end the current monkeypox outbreak.","Corresponding author: Jennifer L.

Racial and ethnic disparities in influenza disease severity and vaccination coverage, along with disparities in access to care, have persisted since the 2009–10 and 2010–11 influenza seasons. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Tailored efforts to increase access to influenza vaccination and improve vaccine confidence among racial and ethnic minority communities, including creating culturally relevant communication campaigns and offering vaccination in nontraditional settings, are critical and might decrease disparities in influenza vaccination and disease severity.

Abstract 
Introduction: CDC estimates that influenza resulted in 9–41 million illnesses, 140,000–710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000–52,000 deaths annually during 2010–2020. Persons from some racial and ethnic minority groups have historically experienced higher rates of severe influenza and had lower influenza vaccination coverage compared with non-Hispanic White (White) persons. This report examines influenza hospitalization and vaccination rates by race and ethnicity during a 12–13-year period (through the 2021–22 influenza season). 

Methods: Data from population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in selected states participating in the Influenza-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) from the 2009–10 through 2021–22 influenza seasons (excluding 2020–21) and influenza vaccination coverage data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from the 2010–11 through 2021–22 influenza seasons were analyzed by race and ethnicity. 

Results: From 2009–10 through 2021–22, age-adjusted influenza hospitalization rates (hospitalizations per 100,000 population) were higher among non-Hispanic Black (Black) (rate ratio [RR] = 1.8), American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN; RR = 1.3), and Hispanic (RR = 1.2) adults, compared with the rate among White adults. During the 2021–22 season, influenza vaccination coverage was lower among Hispanic (37.9%), AI/AN (40.9%), Black (42.0%), and other/multiple race (42.6%) adults compared with that among White (53.9%) and non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) (54.2%) adults; coverage has been consistently higher among White and Asian adults compared with that among Black and Hispanic adults since the 2010–11 season. The disparity in vaccination coverage by race and ethnicity was present among those who reported having medical insurance, a personal health care provider, and a routine medical checkup in the past year. 

Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Racial and ethnic disparities in influenza disease severity and influenza vaccination coverage persist. Health care providers should assess patient vaccination status at all medical visits and offer (or provide a referral for) all recommended vaccines. Tailored programmatic efforts to provide influenza vaccination through nontraditional settings, along with national and community-level efforts to improve awareness of the importance of influenza vaccination in preventing illness, hospitalization, and death among racial and ethnic minority communities might help address health care access barriers and improve vaccine confidence, leading to decreases in disparities in influenza vaccination coverage and disease severity.

Introduction 
Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that can lead to serious illness, hospitalization, and death. CDC estimates that influenza resulted in 9–41 million illnesses, 140,000–710,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000–52,000 deaths annually during 2010–2020 (1,2). Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months except when contraindicated (3). Vaccination provides important protection from influenza illness and its potential complications. For example, during the 2019–20 season, influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 7.5 million influenza illnesses, 105,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 6,300 influenza-associated deaths (4). Persons from some racial and ethnic minority groups experience higher rates of severe influenza and have lower influenza vaccination coverage rates compared with White persons (5,6). This report presents 1) influenza hospitalization rates by race and ethnicity from the 2009–10 through 2021–22 seasons; 2) trends in influenza vaccination coverage by race and ethnicity from the 2010–11 through 2021–22 seasons; and 3) influenza vaccination coverage stratified by race and ethnicity and health care access variables for the 2021–22 season and possible reasons for observed disparities.

Methods 
FluSurv-NET. The Influenza-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) has been previously described (5,7). Briefly, FluSurv-NET conducts all-age, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in selected states representing approximately 8%–9% of the U.S. population. Persons met the FluSurv-NET case definition if they resided in the FluSurv-NET catchment area,* were admitted to a hospital during October 1–April 30† and received a positive influenza test result ≤14 days before hospitalization or during hospitalization. Cases in persons aged <18 years and cases from the 2020–21 season were excluded from this analysis because case counts during this season were too low to calculate rates by race and ethnicity. 

Population denominators used for rate estimation were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics.§ Unadjusted rates, stratified by age group (18–49, 50–64, 65–74, and ≥75 years), race and ethnicity,¶ and influenza season were calculated by dividing the number of hospitalizations by the total catchment population. Unadjusted rates by race, ethnicity, and age group were multiplied by the age distribution of the total FluSurv-NET catchment population to obtain age-adjusted rates; the age groups referenced previously were used for the age adjustment. For rates and rate ratios (RRs), 95% CIs were calculated assuming a simple random sample design and a normal distribution via the SAS STDRATE procedure. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). 

Influenza Vaccination Coverage. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a state-based random-digit–dialed cellular and landline telephone survey that collects information on various health conditions and risk behaviors from one randomly selected adult aged ≥18 years in a household.** BRFSS data for adults aged ≥18 years were analyzed to estimate influenza vaccination coverage for the 2010–11 through 2021–22 influenza seasons. The analysis includes data collected from interviews completed during September–June of each season and vaccine doses received during July–May. Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months, and if so, in which month and year. Vaccination coverage estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, as previously described (6). For the 2021–22 season, for which more detailed data stratified by race and ethnicity and access to care variables are presented, vaccination coverage estimates are based on 291,839 completed interviews; 28,007 respondents were excluded from the analysis because there was no information on whether they had received an influenza vaccine in the past 12 months. The median state BRFSS response rate for a complete or partially complete interview was 42.5% for September–December 2021 and 45.4% for January–June 2022. All estimates were weighted and analyzed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.3; RTI International) statistical software to account for the complex survey design. Differences between estimates were determined using t-tests with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant. 

For each data system, activities were reviewed by CDC and were conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† Sites participating in FluSurv-NET obtained approval from their respective state and local institutional review boards, as applicable. The requirement for informed consent was waived per 45 CFR 46.

Results 
From 2009–10 through 2021–22 (excluding 2020–21), age-adjusted influenza-associated hospitalization rates per 100,000 population among adults, by race and ethnicity were as follows: Black, 78.2; AI/AN, 54.6; Hispanic, 50.3; White, 43.0; and Asian or Pacific Islander (API), 34.5 (Figure 1). Compared with age-adjusted rates among White adults, rates were higher among Black (RR = 1.8), AI/AN (RR = 1.3), and Hispanic adults (RR = 1.2) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121713) with some variation by influenza season. During most influenza seasons, age-adjusted hospitalization rates were highest among Black adults, ranging from 1.5 to 2.4 times the rates among White adults. During the 2011–2012 and 2021–22 seasons, the highest influenza-associated hospitalization rates were among AI/AN adults, with age-adjusted rates 2.7 times those in White adults. Age-adjusted hospitalization rates among Hispanic adults were 2.1 times those among White adults in 2009–10 and 2021–22 (Figure 2) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121713). In every season except 2011–12, API adults had the lowest hospitalization rates among all racial and ethnic groups, from 60% to 90% of those among White adults. 

Overall vaccination coverage in the 2021–22 influenza season was 49.4% among adults aged ≥18 years and varied by race and ethnicity. Coverage was higher among White adults (53.9%) than among AI/AN (40.9%), Hispanic (37.9%), Black (42.0%), and multiracial and adults of other races (42.6%) and was similar to that among Asian adults (54.2%) (Table). From the 2010–11 through 2021–22 seasons, overall adult influenza vaccination coverage increased from 40.5% to 49.4% and increased within all racial and ethnic groups except AI/AN adults (Figure 3). Between the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons, coverage decreased among all adults by 0.8 percentage points and among White adults by 1.6 percentage points. In all other racial and ethnic groups, coverage was stable during the 2018–19 through 2021–22 influenza seasons. Since the 2010–11 influenza season, coverage has been consistently higher among White and Asian adults compared with that among Black and Hispanic adults. 

During the 2021–22 influenza season, vaccination coverage among all racial and ethnic groups was higher among adults aged ≥65 years than among younger adults and among the following groups: those with medical insurance compared with those without medical insurance; those who had a personal health care provider compared with those without a personal health care provider; and those who had had a routine medical checkup in the past year compared with those who had not. However, compared with White adults, Hispanic adults were less likely to have medical insurance, and Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial and adults of other races were less likely to have a personal health care provider and a medical checkup in the past year. In addition, among adults with medical insurance, a personal health care provider, and a routine medical checkup in the past year, and in most age and education strata, influenza vaccination coverage was higher among White adults than among Black, Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial and adults of other races (Table).","Racial and ethnic disparities in influenza-associated hospitalizations were consistently observed among Black, AI/AN, and Hispanic adults compared with White adults, with hospitalization rates an average of 1.2 to 1.8 times those in White adults during the past 13 seasons. Similar disparities have been observed for COVID-19 hospitalizations (8). The reasons for these disparities in severe respiratory disease are likely multifactorial. Influenza vaccination coverage continues to be lower among Black, AI/AN, and Hispanic adults compared with coverage among White and Asian adults. Distrust of the medical system, misperceptions about vaccine safety, and higher levels of concern about side effects have contributed to lower coverage (9). Members of racial and ethnic minority groups might face barriers to affordable, quality health care, including access to health insurance, transportation to health providers, and child care; therefore, they might have fewer opportunities for preventive health care and increased vulnerability to chronic medical conditions (10). Higher prevalences of chronic medical conditions have been independently associated with more severe influenza outcomes (11,12), and downstream effects of structural racism have been demonstrated to affect economic stability, housing, and education (10,13,14). In addition, poverty, crowded housing, and community exposure to respiratory diseases are associated with more severe influenza disease (15,16). 

In contrast to the decline in influenza vaccination observed among children during the COVID-19 pandemic (6), recent coverage among adults has not decreased compared with prepandemic estimates. However, longstanding disparities in coverage by race and ethnicity remain. The finding that adults of some minority racial and ethnic groups were less likely than White adults to have medical insurance and a personal health care provider suggests that access to influenza vaccination likely plays a role in lower coverage among these groups. Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage that were evident early in the COVID-19 vaccination program have decreased or been eliminated over time, likely related to efforts by immunization programs to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination, such as making vaccines available free of charge at varied and nontraditional locations (17,18). However, disparities in COVID-19 booster vaccination are now evident, and differences in influenza vaccination coverage within most socioeconomic and access-to-care strata suggest that in addition to access limitations, other factors contributed to disparities in coverage. A provider recommendation and offer of vaccination is strongly associated with vaccination (19). BRFSS does not collect information on receipt of provider recommendations or offers of vaccination; however, variables such as having a medical checkup in the past year and having a personal health care provider can serve as proxies for these data. Overall, adults who reported having a medical checkup in the past year were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not. Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial and adults of other races were less likely than were White adults to report having a personal health care provider and a routine medical checkup in the past 12 months. Moreover, even among Black, Hispanic, AI/AN, and multiracial and adults of other races who reported a recent medical checkup, influenza vaccination coverage was <50% and was also lower than coverage among White adults with a recent medical checkup, suggesting that missed opportunities for influenza vaccination occurred during these visits. Following the standards for adult immunization practice, providers should assess patient vaccination status at all medical visits and offer (or provide a referral for) all recommended vaccines (20). Meeting this standard in a culturally responsive manner could help reduce observed disparities in vaccination coverage. 

Programmatic efforts and communication campaigns, such as Partnering for Vaccine Equity: Equity in Adult vaccination, that have brought COVID-19 vaccines to communities through nontraditional settings (local libraries, local businesses [e.g., barber shops/salons, thrift stores, restaurants, and grocery stores], and school-based events) likely contributed to decreased disparities in COVID-19 vaccination and might also decrease disparities in influenza vaccination.§§ Surveys collected after 2 years of a tailored vaccination campaign¶¶ collaboratively led by the Ad Council, the American Medical Association, and CDC indicated that concerns about influenza vaccine risks or side effects were reduced from 43% to 33% among Black adults and from 41% to 32% among Hispanic adults. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, because FluSurv-NET surveillance is conducted in selected counties within the United States, findings might not represent the entire U.S. population. Second, influenza-associated hospitalizations reported to FluSurv-NET are identified by clinician-directed testing; hospitalization rates might be underestimated, as they have not been adjusted for testing practices, which differ by surveillance site, age group, and timing during influenza seasons (2) and might also vary by race and ethnicity. Third, within FluSurv-NET data, approximately 17% of persons were missing ethnicity and were classified based only on their reported race; 7% were missing race. Fourth, weighting adjustments for BRFSS survey data used to assess influenza vaccination coverage might not eliminate all possible bias from incomplete sample frame because households with no telephones are excluded. Fifth, survey response rates were low, and influenza vaccination coverage might differ between survey respondents and nonrespondents; survey weighting adjustments might not adequately control for these differences. Sixth, influenza vaccination status was self-reported and subject to recall error and social desirability bias. Finally, errors in BRFSS data from incomplete sample frame, nonresponse, and accuracy of reported influenza vaccination status might change over time, which could lead to inaccurate assessment of trends in vaccination coverage. 

The findings in this report highlight persistent disparities in influenza disease severity among adults in some racial and ethnic minority groups during 2009–2022, as well as continued disparities in influenza vaccination coverage among adults during the same period. Increasing influenza vaccination coverage among racial and ethnic minorities could reduce disparities in the risk for severe disease. National, state, and community-level efforts to build trust, increase access to vaccination services, and combat misinformation among racial and ethnic minority communities are important actions for increasing vaccination coverage in these groups. Interventions that support and promote partnerships at the community level to effectively reduce racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination include creating and training (or partnering with) a network of local community trusted messengers reflecting the communities served; using trusted messengers to address misinformation and promote accurate, culturally responsive vaccine messages, including through social media; and working with culturally competent health care providers to provide a strong recommendation for influenza vaccination. National, tailored influenza vaccination campaigns can reinforce local efforts to increase awareness of the importance of influenza vaccination among target audiences to encourage increased vaccination coverage among these groups.","Corresponding author: Carla L.

Influenza and COVID-19 vaccines are recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months, including health care personnel (HCP). 

What is added by this report? 

HCP influenza vaccination coverage was 79.9% during the 2021–22 season; 87.3% completed primary COVID-19 vaccination, 67.1% of whom received a COVID-19 booster dose. Influenza, primary COVID-19, and COVID-19 booster coverage was higher among HCP who reported employer vaccination requirements for those vaccines; coverage was lowest among HCP working in long-term care settings. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Enhanced efforts are needed to improve HCP vaccination coverage, especially with COVID-19 booster doses and annually for influenza vaccines. Staying up to date with COVID-19 and influenza vaccines can protect HCP and their patients.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC recommend that all health care personnel (HCP) receive annual influenza vaccination to reduce influenza-related morbidity and mortality among these personnel and their patients (1). ACIP also recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months, including HCP, be vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines and remain up to date (2,3). During March 29–April 19, 2022, CDC conducted an opt-in Internet panel survey of 3,618 U.S. HCP to estimate influenza vaccination coverage during the 2021–22 influenza season as well as receipt of the primary COVID-19 vaccination series and a booster dose. Influenza vaccination coverage was 79.9% during the 2021–22 season, and 87.3% of HCP reported having completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series; among these HCP, 67.1% reported receiving a COVID-19 booster dose. Among HCP, influenza, COVID-19 primary series, and COVID-19 booster dose vaccination coverage were lowest among assistants and aides, those working in long-term care (LTC) or home health care settings, and those whose employer neither required nor recommended the vaccines. Overall, employer requirements for influenza and COVID-19 primary series vaccines were reported by 43.9% and 59.9% of HCP, respectively; among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, 23.5% reported employer requirements for COVID-19 booster vaccines. Vaccination coverage for all three vaccine measures was higher among HCP who reported employer vaccination requirements and ranged from 95.8% to 97.3% for influenza, 90.2% to 95.1% for COVID-19 primary series, and 76.4% to 87.8% for COVID-19 booster vaccinations among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, by work setting. Implementing workplace strategies demonstrated to improve vaccination coverage among HCP, including vaccination requirements or active promotion of vaccination, can increase influenza and COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP and reduce influenza and COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality among HCP and their patients (4). 

An Internet panel survey of HCP was conducted during March 29–April 19, 2022, to provide estimates of influenza and COVID-19 vaccination coverage among HCP during the 2021–22 influenza season. Similar surveys have been conducted annually since the 2010–11 influenza season, and previously published results from the 2020–21 season are available (5). Respondents were recruited from two preexisting national opt-in Internet sources: Medscape,* a medical website managed by WebMD Health Professional Network, and general population Internet panels operated by Dynata.† Responses were weighted to the distribution of the U.S. population of HCP§ by occupation,¶ age, sex, race and ethnicity, work setting, and U.S. Census Bureau region. A poststratification weight for each survey respondent was calculated by fitting a generalized exponential model and estimating the model parameters using calibration equations (6). Among 3,830 eligible participants, a total of 3,679 completed the survey (completion rate = 96.1%**). Sixty-one participants were excluded because they did not report their occupational setting or indicated a setting other than those listed, and the verbatim description did not qualify as a health care setting, leaving 3,618 respondents in the analytic sample. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† 

Estimated (weighted) proportions and corresponding 95% CIs for three vaccination measures (influenza vaccination coverage for the 2021–22 season, COVID-19 vaccination coverage [i.e., receipt of ≥1 dose and completion of primary series§§], and COVID-19 booster vaccination¶¶) were estimated for each work setting, occupation, and demographic characteristic. LTC settings include nursing homes, assisted living facilities, other long-term care facilities, home health agencies, and home health care. Employer requirements for all three vaccination measures were assessed through three separate questions.*** The Korn-Graubard method was used to calculate CIs for proportions, assuming that the weighted estimates were approximately unbiased.††† CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics reliability criteria for proportions were applied to the estimates in the descriptive analyses of HCP characteristics (7). T-tests were used to assess differences among subgroups; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.1; RTI International) were used to conduct all analyses. 

Overall, 79.9% of HCP reported having received an influenza vaccination during the 2021–22 season, not significantly different from the 75.9% reported during the 2020–21 season (Table 1). During the 2021–22 season, higher influenza vaccination coverage was reported among HCP with either a master’s, professional, or doctoral degree (92.3%) and an associate or bachelor’s degree (80.2%) than among those with some college education or less (66.7%). Influenza vaccination coverage was lower among nurse practitioners and physician assistants (92.4%), nurses (87.8%), other clinical personnel (87.8%), nonclinical HCP (75.7%), and assistants and aides (68.8%) compared with coverage among physicians (96.8%). Influenza vaccination coverage during 2021–22 was highest among HCP working in hospitals (92.0%) and lowest among HCP working in LTC settings (66.4%). Coverage was higher among HCP who reported an employer requirement for influenza vaccination (96.8%) than among those who reported an employer recommendation (76.5%) or no recommendation or requirement for vaccination (48.1%). Compared with the 2020–21 influenza season, increases in influenza vaccination coverage were observed among HCP aged 30–45 years (7.5 percentage points), those with more than a college degree (10.9 percentage points), physicians (5.5 percentage points), and pharmacists (4.3 percentage points). 

Overall, 89.9% of HCP reported having received ≥1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 87.3% reported having completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series (Table 2). Among those who completed the primary series, 67.1% reported having received a COVID-19 booster vaccine dose. Completion of primary COVID-19 vaccination was higher among HCP with more than a college degree (97.0%), those with an associate or bachelor’s degree (87.3%), physicians (98.7%), those who received an influenza vaccination during the 2020–21 influenza season (94.1%), and those working in hospitals (91.6%), nonrural areas (88.6%), and facilities where their employer required COVID-19 vaccination (93.1%) compared with the respective reference groups. Similar patterns were observed for receipt of a COVID-19 booster vaccine dose, with the addition of higher coverage among HCP aged 45–59 years (71.7%) and ≥60 years (87.0%), and lower coverage among female HCP (64.7%) and those working in the U.S. Census Bureau South Region (59.8%). 

Employer requirements for receipt of influenza and COVID-19 primary series vaccination were reported by 43.9% and 59.9% of HCP, respectively (Figure). Overall, among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, 23.5% reported employer requirement for COVID-19 booster vaccination. HCP working in LTC settings were less likely to report requirements for receipt of any vaccine compared with HCP working in hospitals and ambulatory care settings. Coverage with influenza vaccine, the primary COVID-19 series, and a COVID-19 booster dose was higher among HCP who reported an employer requirement for vaccination than among those who reported an employer recommendation or neither a recommendation nor requirement for vaccination. Among HCP who reported employer vaccination requirements, influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 95.8% to 97.3%, COVID-19 primary series vaccination coverage ranged from 90.2% to 95.1%, and COVID-19 booster vaccination coverage among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines ranged from 76.4% to 87.8%, by work setting. Among HCP who reported that their employer neither recommended nor required vaccinations, influenza vaccination coverage ranged from 40.1% to 64.2%, COVID-19 primary series vaccination coverage ranged from 54.4% to 62.8%, and among HCP who completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, COVID-19 booster vaccination coverage ranged from 46.1% to 59.7%, by work setting.","View LargerOverall influenza vaccination coverage among HCP during the 2021–22 season was similar to that during the previous season. As observed during previous influenza seasons, nonclinical personnel, assistants and aides, HCP working in LTC settings, HCP with less than a college degree, and HCP who reported their employer neither required nor recommended the influenza vaccine had the lowest vaccination coverage (5). Similar patterns were observed for COVID-19 vaccination coverage, although coverage with the primary COVID-19 vaccination series was ≥80% in all work settings, including LTC settings, possibly, in part, because of the prioritization of HCP when the U.S. vaccination program commenced in December 2020 and a relatively high prevalence of employers required COVID-19 vaccination among HCP. Although the prevalence of reported requirements for influenza vaccination during the 2021–22 season increased by approximately 10 percentage points compared with those during the 2020–21 season, requirements for influenza vaccination were lower than were those for COVID-19 vaccination in most work settings, especially LTC settings. Requirements for COVID-19 booster vaccination were infrequently reported in all work settings by HCP who had completed the primary COVID-19 vaccination series, even among hospitals, a large percentage of which had requirements for influenza and COVID-19 primary vaccination. Thus, compared with primary COVID-19 vaccination coverage, influenza vaccination coverage was lower in nonhospital settings, and COVID-19 booster vaccination coverage was lower in all settings. Given that vaccine-induced immunity wanes over time after vaccination, remaining up to date with all COVID-19 recommended vaccination is important for all eligible persons to prevent COVID-19–related hospitalization and severe outcomes, and for HCP to protect their patients (3,8). In September 2022, CDC recommended an updated bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccination to provide enhanced protection against circulating strains of COVID-19 (9). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the study used a nonprobability sample of volunteer members of Medscape and Dynata Internet panels. Responses were weighted to be representative of the U.S. population of HCP; however, some bias might remain in the coverage estimates. Second, the self-selection of respondents to the panels and to the survey might introduce selection bias if participation in the panel or survey is related to likelihood of being vaccinated. Third, vaccination status was self-reported and might be subject to recall or social desirability bias. Finally, insufficient sample size resulted in the coverage estimates in some subgroups not meeting the National Center for Health Statistics reliability criteria for reporting proportions. 

HCP coverage with influenza vaccine, the primary COVID-19 vaccination series, and a booster COVID-19 dose was highest among those who reported employer vaccination requirements for the respective vaccines. Work settings that successfully implemented requirements for primary COVID-19 vaccination could consider the same requirements for COVID-19 booster doses to restore protection among HCP that has declined since their previous vaccination. In addition, many LTC settings now have experience implementing COVID-19 vaccine requirements and could consider these requirements for influenza vaccination to improve influenza vaccination coverage. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services requires that many health care settings report both influenza§§§ and COVID-19¶¶¶ HCP vaccination data to CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network; the interim final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services also requires LTC settings to offer the COVID-19 vaccine to staff members and residents and to educate them about benefits and potential side effects, which might increase vaccination coverage in these settings.**** In addition, useful resources that can help to increase vaccination coverage among HCP include CDC’s long term care web-based toolkit,†††† which provides access to resources, strategies, and educational materials, and interventions recommended by the Community Preventive Services Task Force and CDC (4,10). Annual influenza vaccination and staying up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines are critical in prevention of severe disease as well as reduction of influenza and COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality among HCP and their patients.","Corresponding author: Hilda Razzaghi, hrazzaghi@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Razzaghi H, Srivastav A, de Perio MA, Laney AS, Black CL.

Specifically, dispensing rates for the 4-week period during April 24–May 21, 2022, were 122 per 100,000 residents (19% of overall population-adjusted dispensing rates) in high-vulnerability zip codes compared with 247 (42%) in medium-vulnerability and 274 (39%) in low-vulnerability zip codes. This report provides an updated analysis of dispensing rates by zip code–level social vulnerability and highlights important intervention strategies.

Data on dispensed numbers of COVID-19 oral antiviral treatment courses are obtained at regular intervals (at least twice per week) from each provider site receiving medications. The HHS Health Partner Ordering Portal is used by oral antiviral provider partners, including those in all U.S. states and jurisdictions, the Federal Retail Pharmacy Therapeutics Program, and Federal entities (e.g., Indian Health Service, Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the U.S. Department of Defense), to order oral antivirals at no cost and to report inventory and product use.¶ Total courses of Paxlovid and Lagevrio dispensed were analyzed by week and zip-code social vulnerability level, using the zip code of the dispensing site. Zip codes were classified as having low, medium, or high social vulnerability, using the same methodology that was used in a previous report**,†† (3).This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§

Overall dispensing of oral antivirals increased 57%, from 643 per 100,000 persons during April 24–May 21, 2022, to 1,012 during July 31–August 28. Compared with data collected during April 24–May 21, dispensing during the most recent 4-week period (July 31–August 28) increased to 315 per 100,000 persons (31% of overall population-adjusted dispensing rates) in high vulnerability zip codes, 367 (36%) in medium-vulnerability zip codes, and 331 (33%) in low-vulnerability zip codes (Figure), representing increases in dispensing rates of 159%, 48%, and 21%, respectively. These data indicate a narrowing of the dispensing gap among high-vulnerability and medium-and low-vulnerability zip codes; at the same time, overall dispensing increased.

HHS worked closely with states and territories to improve equitable dispensing, with a focus on increasing education and awareness¶¶ and enhancing distribution efforts, including COVID-19–focused teleprescribing programs, mobile test-to-treat sites, prepositioning of oral antivirals at provider sites in high-vulnerability zip codes, and increased distribution to federally qualified health centers. These efforts were designed to reduce barriers to access by making it easier to satisfy the requirements necessary to receive a clinical assessment to obtain a prescription and begin oral antiviral medication within 5 days of symptom onset. Although both oral antivirals continue to be prescribed primarily by physicians or advanced practice providers, on July 6, 2022, FDA updated the Paxlovid EUA to allow state-licensed pharmacists to prescribe it for an individual patient under certain conditions, including having sufficient data on the patient’s medical history and use of other medications.*** However, pharmacy prescribing of Paxlovid has not yet been widely implemented because of these limitations on prescribing and unclear reimbursement structure for pharmacists to prescribe. Increased dispensing in high-vulnerability zip codes represents valuable progress toward improving access to COVID-19 medications among populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic; however, additional work is needed. Limitations of this analysis include reliance on sites’ self-reported dispensing data, lack of patient-specific data (including demographic and clinical outcome data), and lack of correlative analysis of COVID-19 incidence to overall dispensing rates in specific zip codes.

The COVID-19 therapeutics program represents the largest scale HHS distribution of antivirals, with approximately 16 million COVID-19 treatment courses delivered through August 2022. Ensuring equitable access to antivirals is essential to improving patient outcomes.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Meghan E.

Patients with monkeypox can experience serious ocular complications, which are not well described during the current outbreak.

What is added by this report?

This report describes five cases of ocular monkeypox identified in the United States during July–September 2022. Patients with ocular monkeypox, including those with HIV-associated immunocompromise, have experienced delays in treatment initiation, prolonged illness, hospitalization, and vision impairment.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Health care providers and public health practitioners should be aware that ocular monkeypox, although rare, is a sight-threatening condition. Patients with signs and symptoms compatible with ocular monkeypox should be considered for urgent ophthalmologic evaluation and treatment. Prompt notification of public health officials can help support these efforts.

As of October 11, 2022, a total of 26,577 monkeypox cases had been reported in the United States.* Although most cases of monkeypox are self-limited, lesions that involve anatomically vulnerable sites can cause complications. Ocular monkeypox can occur when Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is introduced into the eye (e.g., from autoinoculation), potentially causing conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, and loss of vision (1,start highlight2end highlight). This report describes five patients who acquired ocular monkeypox during July–September 2022. All patients received treatment with tecovirimat (Tpoxx)†; four also received topical trifluridine (Viroptic).§ Two patients had HIV-associated immunocompromise and experienced delays between clinical presentation with monkeypox and initiation of monkeypox-directed treatment. Four patients were hospitalized, and one experienced marked vision impairment. To decrease the risk for autoinoculation, persons with monkeypox should be advised to practice hand hygiene and to avoid touching their eyes, which includes refraining from using contact lenses (start highlight3end highlight). Health care providers and public health practitioners should be aware that ocular monkeypox, although rare, is a sight-threatening condition. Patients with signs and symptoms compatible with ocular monkeypox should be considered for urgent ophthalmologic evaluation and initiation of monkeypox-directed treatment. Public health officials should be promptly notified of cases of ocular monkeypox. Increased clinician awareness of ocular monkeypox and of approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment might reduce associated morbidity.

During the 2022 multinational outbreak, CDC has provided consultation to clinicians treating patients with monkeypox.¶ This report describes demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes as of October 11 for five patients who received a diagnosis of ocular monkeypox during July–September 2022. Ocular monkeypox was defined as the presence of new ocular disease compatible with Orthopoxvirus (OPXV) infection in a patient with probable or confirmed monkeypox** and no alternative explanation for the ocular disease. CDC obtained data during clinical consultation and worked with treating clinicians and jurisdictional health departments to follow patient progress. Patient permission for the use of the clinical image was obtained. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††


Patient A
In August 2022, a man aged 20–29 years with HIV disease (Table) (Figure 1) (CD4 = 25 cells/mm3, not receiving antiretroviral therapy [ART]) was evaluated in an outpatient clinic for a rash on his buttocks, chest, arms, and hands that was compatible with monkeypox.§§ Swabs collected from lesions on his chest were sent for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for OPXV, and results were negative. Ten days later, the patient presented for care again, this time with progressive rash as well as left eye symptoms, including pain, itching, swelling, discharge, foreign body sensation, photosensitivity, and vision changes. The rash was swabbed again to test for OPXV, and he was provided a referral to ophthalmology. Seven days later, PCR testing returned positive results for OPXV, and he commenced treatment with oral tecovirimat. Two days later, he was admitted to a hospital because of worsening ocular symptoms. Ophthalmologic exam was notable for left eye conjunctivitis. Visual acuity in the left eye was 20/40. The patient started intravenous tecovirimat and topical trifluridine drops to his left eye on admission, and he was initiated on ART. His ocular symptoms improved, and he was discharged after 5 days with prescriptions for oral tecovirimat, topical trifluridine, and ART. During the next 4 weeks he developed new facial lesions and decreasing left eye vision, for which he was readmitted to the hospital; health care providers suspected nonadherence with prescribed medications. Ophthalmologic examination revealed left eye conjunctivitis, keratitis, and a conjunctival ulcer (Figure 2). Left eye visual acuity was measured at 20/300. A swab of the conjunctival lesion yielded a positive PCR test result for OPXV, and biopsy showed necroulcerative conjunctivitis with extensive intralesional orthopoxviral antigen detected by immunohistochemistry. The patient was restarted on intravenous tecovirimat, and his left eye was treated with topical trifluridine for 1 week as well as topical povidone-iodine. Currently, the patient is on day 14 of intravenous tecovirimat and remains hospitalized for treatment of ocular monkeypox. He has experienced waxing and waning of left eye pain, irritation, and photosensitivity. Left eye visual acuity was most recently measured at 20/800 (profound visual impairment), although bedside visual acuity assessments have been challenging. His prognosis for vision recovery is currently unknown.


Patient B
In July 2022, a man aged 30–39 years with HIV disease (CD4 = 78 cells/mm3, not on ART) was evaluated at an emergency department with a rash on his chest, legs, perianal area, and face, including on the bridge of his nose near his right eye (Table) (Figure 1). Swabs of lesions from his face and scalp were taken to test for OPXV, but because tecovirimat was not available in the emergency department, he was referred to an outpatient clinic to receive tecovirimat. The swabs tested PCR-positive for OPXV. The patient was evaluated at an outpatient clinic 9 days after testing and was prescribed ART and 14 days of oral tecovirimat. His rash began to resolve during treatment. Two weeks after completion of tecovirimat, he developed new and worsening facial lesions. The lesion on his nose expanded onto the right medial canthus and over the conjunctiva, and he experienced right eye redness, pain, itching, and photosensitivity, for which he was hospitalized. He did not experience vision changes. Ophthalmologic exam results were notable for right eye conjunctivitis, several small conjunctival nodular lesions, and corneal ulcers. He was treated again with intravenous tecovirimat for 10 days and with topical trifluridine drops for 5 days and antibacterial eye drops to the right eye. He was discharged upon regression of the eye lesion and improvement in conjunctivitis 10 days after admission, without further treatment for monkeypox.


Patient C
In August 2022, a previously healthy man aged 30–39 years developed rectal pain and perianal lesions. He went to an emergency department 3 days later and swabs of those lesions were taken for OPXV testing (Table) (Figure 1). Three days later, when the swabs yielded positive PCR test results for OPXV, the patient was prescribed oral tecovirimat for rectal pain. Two days later, he was evaluated again in the emergency department with right eye pain, redness and discharge. He did not experience vision changes. Ophthalmologic exam was notable for right eye conjunctivitis. He subsequently developed bilateral conjunctivitis; the treating physicians suspected the patient had autoinoculated both eyes with MPXV by rubbing them. The patient’s bilateral conjunctivitis persisted for 3 weeks after resolution of his perianal lesions. The course of tecovirimat was extended until all ocular symptoms resolved, which occurred after 1 month of treatment.


Patient D
In August 2022, a previously healthy man aged 30–39 years developed a groin rash (Table) (Figure 1). One week later, he was examined at an emergency department for right eye redness, pain, and eyelid swelling. He reported rubbing his right eye. Lesions were noted on his penis, abdomen, and one wrist. Samples were collected from the body lesions for OPXV testing; the patient received empiric treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Providers attributed the eye symptoms to bacterial preseptal cellulitis and he was discharged on oral antibiotics. Two days later, the patient returned with multiple right eyelid lesions, periorbital swelling, and eye pain, for which he was admitted to a hospital. He did not experience vision changes. Ophthalmologic exam was notable for right eye conjunctivitis as well as four ulcers on the eyelid margin and three lesions on the palpebral conjunctiva, which were swabbed for OPXV testing. He was started on oral tecovirimat empirically, after which all test results from swabs of skin and eye lesions returned PCR-positive for OPXV. The patient also received topical trifluridine for 5 days and antibacterial drops to the right eye, as well as intravenous antibiotics for preseptal cellulitis. He was discharged upon clinical improvement 5 days after admission, to complete a 14-day course of oral tecovirimat.


Patient E
In July 2022, a previously healthy woman aged 30–39 years was evaluated for pustular lesions on her vaginal labia (Table) (Figure 1). A swab of those lesions tested PCR-positive for OPXV. During the week after symptom onset, lesions spread to her back, buttocks, chin, forehead, and left lower eyelid. She began experiencing left eye pain and redness. She sought medical care after noticing a lesion on the globe of her left eye, for which she was admitted to a hospital. Ophthalmologic exam was notable for left eye conjunctivitis, a bulbar conjunctival lesion, and a subconjunctival nodule. She did not experience vision changes. start highlightNeither tecovirimat nor trifluridine was immediately available; the patient was treated with naproxen.end highlight Her ocular symptoms improved, and she was discharged after 3 days with a 14-day course of oral tecovirimat and start highlighta 5-day course of topical trifluridine (2).","This report highlights the varying clinical manifestations of ocular monkeypox and the importance of prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent sight-threatening complications. All five patients with ocular monkeypox described in this report suffered prolonged illness, four were hospitalized, and one experienced significant vision impairment. Two patients had HIV-associated immunocompromise and experienced delays in initiation of treatment for monkeypox. One of these patients experienced vision loss; he remains in treatment and his prognosis for vision recovery is currently unknown. Urgent referral for ophthalmologic evaluation and prompt antiviral therapy should be considered for patients with monkeypox and ocular signs or symptoms (e.g., vision changes or eye pain, itching, redness, swelling, or foreign body sensation) or lesions near the eye. Clinicians should consider initiation of prompt systemic antiviral therapy as well as topical trifluridine for patients with ocular monkeypox.¶¶ 

Several strategies might help prevent ocular monkeypox and associated complications. To decrease the risk for autoinoculation, persons with monkeypox should be advised to practice hand hygiene and to avoid touching their eyes, which includes refraining from using contact lenses start highlight(3).end highlight Short turnaround times for OPXV/MPXV PCR test results might help prevent delays in treatment initiation. For persons with suspected ocular monkeypox, or for persons with suspected monkeypox who are at risk for severe manifestations of the disease (e.g., those with HIV-associated immunocompromise), clinicians might consider initiating empiric treatment for monkeypox while test results are pending. Health care providers can contact their public health jurisdictions and CDC for support on the use of medical countermeasures to treat patients with monkeypox*** start highlight(4).end highlight 

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the cases described might not be representative of patients with ocular monkeypox in the United States, and conclusions cannot be drawn about the frequency of reported events. Although the frequency of ocular monkeypox during the current outbreak is unknown, national surveillance data from the United States suggest that 5% of patients with monkeypox report ocular symptoms††† start highlight(5).end highlight Second, not every patient underwent testing of ocular lesions for OPXV/MPXV or exhaustive testing for other ocular infections. However, the clinical findings in these patients were compatible with descriptions of ocular monkeypox from other studies start highlight(6,7).end highlight 

Ocular monkeypox is a potentially sight-threatening infection. Urgent ophthalmologic evaluation and the provision of timely medical countermeasures for patients with suspected or confirmed ocular monkeypox might help prevent poor outcomes.","Corresponding author: Shama Cash-Goldwasser, tqx7@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Cash-Goldwasser S, Labuda SM, McCormick DW, et al.

COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) data among immunocompromised persons during SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant predominance are limited. 

What is added by this report? 

Among immunocompromised adults hospitalized with a COVID-like illness, 2-dose monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization during Omicron predominance was 36%. VE was 67% ≥7 days after a third dose during BA.1 predominance but declined during BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 predominance to 32% ≥90 days after dose 3 and 43% ≥7 days after dose 4. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Monovalent COVID-19 vaccine protection among persons with immunocompromising conditions during Omicron predominance was moderate after a 3-dose primary series or booster dose. Persons with immunocompromising conditions might benefit from updated bivalent boosters that target circulating BA.4/BA.5 sublineages.

Persons with moderate-to-severe immunocompromising conditions might have reduced protection after COVID-19 vaccination, compared with persons without immunocompromising conditions (1–3). On August 13, 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that adults with immunocompromising conditions receive an expanded primary series of 3 doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. ACIP followed with recommendations on September 23, 2021, for a fourth (booster) dose and on September 1, 2022, for a new bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose, containing components of the BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant (4). Data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) of monovalent COVID-19 vaccines among persons with immunocompromising conditions since the emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 are limited. In the multistate VISION Network,§ monovalent 2-, 3-, and 4-dose mRNA VE against COVID-19–related hospitalization were estimated among adults with immunocompromising conditions¶ hospitalized with COVID-19–like illness,** using a test-negative design comparing odds of previous vaccination among persons with a positive or negative molecular test result (case-patients and control-patients) for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). During December 16, 2021–August 20, 2022, among SARS-CoV-2 test-positive case-patients, 1,815 (36.3%), 1,387 (27.7%), 1,552 (31.0%), and 251 (5.0%) received 0, 2, 3, and 4 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses, respectively. Among test-negative control-patients during this period, 6,928 (23.7%), 7,411 (25.4%), 12,734 (43.6%), and 2,142 (7.3%) received these respective doses. Overall, VE against COVID-19–related hospitalization among adults with immunocompromising conditions hospitalized for COVID-like illness during Omicron predominance was 36% ≥14 days after dose 2, 69% 7–89 days after dose 3, and 44% ≥90 days after dose 3. Restricting the analysis to later periods when Omicron sublineages BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 were predominant and 3-dose recipients were eligible to receive a fourth dose, VE was 32% ≥90 days after dose 3 and 43% ≥7 days after dose 4. Protection offered by vaccination among persons with immunocompromising conditions during Omicron predominance was moderate even after a 3-dose monovalent primary series or booster dose. Given the incomplete protection against hospitalization afforded by monovalent COVID-19 vaccines, persons with immunocompromising conditions might benefit from updated bivalent vaccine booster doses that target recently circulating Omicron sublineages, in line with ACIP recommendations. Further, additional protective recommendations for persons with immunocompromising conditions, including the use of prophylactic antibody therapy, early access to and use of antivirals, and enhanced nonpharmaceutical interventions such as well-fitting masks or respirators, should also be considered. 

VISION Network methods to assess VE have been previously described (3,5). For this analysis, among adults aged ≥18 years, eligible medical encounters were defined as hospitalizations of patients with one or more immunocompromising conditions and a COVID-19–like illness diagnosis who underwent SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing ≤14 days before to <72 hours after the encounter date. Immunocompromising conditions were identified from electronic medical records based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) discharge diagnosis codes associated with being immunocompromised (3). Vaccination status was obtained from electronic health records or immunization registries. Two-dose vaccination was defined as receipt of a second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine ≥14 days before the index date;†† 3- and 4-dose vaccinations were defined as receipt of the most recent dose ≥7 days before the index date. Persons with no documented COVID-19 vaccine doses were considered unvaccinated. Encounters for persons who received a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, only 1 dose, >4 doses, dose 2 <14 days before the index date, dose 3 or 4 <7 days before the index date, or who received doses before vaccine was recommended by ACIP were excluded.§§ The study period began on the date when ≥50% of sequenced specimens for each study site yielded an Omicron variant based on local surveillance data (site-specific start dates ranged from December 16 to 29, 2021) and ended August 20, 2022; start and end dates for Omicron sublineage predominance periods for BA.1 (including the original BA.1.1.529 variant and BA.1.1 and BA.1 sublineages), BA.2/BA.2.12.1, and BA.4/BA.5 were defined as the site-specific dates of ≥50% sublineage predominance¶¶,***,†††. 

VE was estimated using a test-negative design, comparing the odds of being vaccinated versus unvaccinated between persons with a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result (case-patients and control-patients, respectively). Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for age, geographic region,§§§ calendar time, and local percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results¶¶¶ and weighted for the inverse propensity to be vaccinated or unvaccinated**** (5). VE of 2- and 3-doses was estimated for the full Omicron period (all sublineages combined) and for each sublineage predominance period. VE estimates for 4 doses were restricted to a combined period including BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 periods because of limited 4-dose coverage among eligible persons before mid-March 2022.†††† VE was estimated among all persons with one or more immunocompromising condition and then separately among persons who had a single condition in one of five mutually exclusive immunocompromising condition categories: 1) solid malignancies, 2) hematologic malignancies, 3) rheumatologic or inflammatory disorders, 4) other intrinsic immune conditions or immunodeficiencies, or 5) organ or stem cell transplants. VE was also estimated among recipients of an organ or stem cell transplant without excluding those with other immunocompromising conditions and among persons with any immunocompromising condition except an organ or stem cell transplant. Estimates with nonoverlapping 95% CIs were considered significantly different. Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.1; R Foundation). The study was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at participating sites or under a reliance agreement with the institutional review board of Westat, Inc. This activity was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§§ 

During December 16, 2021–August 20, 2022, among 34,220 eligible hospitalizations for COVID-19–like illness in adults with immunocompromising conditions (median age = 69 years; IQR = 58–78 years), 8,798 (25.7%), 14,286 (41.7%), and 2,393 (7.0%) patients had received 2, 3, and 4 COVID-19 vaccine doses, respectively, including 11,088 (32.4% of all patients included) who received dose 3 ≥90 days before the index date and were therefore eligible for a fourth dose (Table 1). VE during the full Omicron period was 36% (95% CI = 30–41) ≥14 days after dose 2, 69% (95% CI = 63–74) 7–89 days after dose 3, and 44% (95% CI = 37–49) ≥90 days after dose 3 (Table 2). When stratified by sublineage period, VE was higher ≥7 days after receipt of dose 3 during the BA.1 period (67%; median interval since vaccination = 99 days) than during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 (32%; median interval = 172 days) and BA.4/BA.5 periods (35%; median interval = 239 days). During the combined BA2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 periods, when persons with immunocompromising conditions were eligible to receive a fourth dose, VE ≥90 days after dose 3 was 32% (median interval = 196 days), and ≥7 days after dose 4 was 43% (median interval = 61 days). 

VE ≥7 days after receipt of dose 3 varied by immunocompromising condition, ranging from 43% among persons with an organ or stem cell transplant (with or without another condition) to 70% among those with a solid malignancy only (Table 3).","In this multistate analysis of over 34,000 hospitalizations for COVID-19–like illness among adults with immunocompromising conditions, 2 doses of monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were 36% effective against COVID-19–associated hospitalization during a period of Omicron variant predominance. VE increased to 67% with the addition of a third dose of monovalent vaccine during BA.1 predominance but declined during the combined BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 periods to 32% ≥90 days after dose 3 and 43% ≥7 days after a monovalent fourth dose. These results suggest that monovalent COVID-19 vaccination among persons with immunocompromising conditions conferred moderate protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization during Omicron circulation, with lower protection during BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 sublineage predominance periods. 

Although protection increased after receipt of a third monovalent vaccine dose (compared with 2 doses), estimated 3-dose VE was lower in this study than in other similar studies among immunocompetent persons during Omicron predominance, including recent VISION Network analyses (6,7). Consistent with previous studies restricted to persons with immunocompromising conditions, VE in this study was lower among persons with certain immunocompromising conditions that might be associated with being more severely immunocompromised, particularly solid organ or stem cell transplant recipients. 

Estimated VE among persons with immunocompromising conditions during Omicron predominance was lower than VE in comparable studies during Delta variant predominance (2). Protection was also lower during Omicron BA.2/BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 than during BA.1 predominance, although the median interval since receipt of last vaccine dose was lower during BA.1, and waning effectiveness over time might have also contributed to the lower VE observed during these later sublineage periods. In either case, these findings suggest that the newly authorized bivalent booster vaccines, which target BA.4/BA.5 might offer additional benefit to persons with immunocompromising conditions (8). 

Given the moderate protection observed even after monovalent booster doses, persons with immunocompromising conditions might also benefit from other recommended protective measures including preexposure prophylaxis with the antibody treatment tixagevimab/cilgavimab (Evusheld),¶¶¶¶ which was authorized in December 2021 for persons with moderate-to-severe immunocompromising conditions and was associated with a reduction in risk for both symptomatic and severe COVID-19 in clinical trials (9). However, recent in vitro data suggest protection against emerging Omicron sublineages might be reduced and additional clinical data are needed (10). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, immunocompromising conditions were based on discharge diagnosis codes and a range of immune suppression is associated with each code. Second, residual confounding in VE models is possible. For example, history of previous infection could not be accurately ascertained, but might have differed between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, which could affect VE estimates. Third, data on the use of outpatient treatments such as nirmatelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) or prophylaxis with Evusheld were not available. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing data were unavailable for individual encounters, and date of testing was used to assign likely sublineage ecologically. 

Persons with immunocompromising conditions have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas monovalent vaccination remains moderately protective in persons with immunocompromising conditions, VE has decreased compared with that during pre-Omicron periods, most notably during recent Omicron sublineage predominance periods, despite expanded dosing recommendations. Given the incomplete protection against hospitalization afforded by monovalent COVID-19 vaccines, persons with immunocompromising conditions might benefit from updated bivalent boosters that target BA.4/BA.5 sublineages. In addition, other protective measures recommended for persons with immunocompromising conditions, including prophylactic antibody treatments, early access to and use of antivirals, and nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as the use of well-fitting masks or respirators, should also be considered. Further study of VE of updated vaccines in persons with immunocompromising conditions is warranted.","Corresponding author: Amadea Britton, lto7@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Britton A, Embi PJ, Levy ME, et al.

Eligible adults aged ≥18 years should receive an updated bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine to maximize protection against BA.4/BA.5 lineages and to prevent COVID-19–associated hospitalization.

The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 or BA.1) became predominant in the United States by late December 2021 (1). BA.1 has since been replaced by emerging lineages BA.2 (including BA.2.12.1) in March 2022, followed by BA.4 and BA.5, which have accounted for a majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections since late June 2022 (1). Data on the effectiveness of monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against BA.4/BA.5-associated hospitalizations are limited, and their interpretation is complicated by waning of vaccine-induced immunity (2–5). Further, infections with earlier Omicron lineages, including BA.1 and BA.2, reduce vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates because certain persons in the referent unvaccinated group have protection from infection-induced immunity. The IVY Network† assessed effectiveness of 2, 3, and 4 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccines compared with no vaccination against COVID-19–associated hospitalization among immunocompetent adults aged ≥18 years during December 26, 2021–August 31, 2022. During the BA.1/BA.2 period, VE 14–150 days after a second dose was 63% and decreased to 34% after 150 days. Similarly, VE 7–120 days after a third dose was 79% and decreased to 41% after 120 days. VE 7–120 days after a fourth dose was 61%. During the BA.4/BA.5 period, similar trends were observed, although CIs for VE estimates between categories of time since the last dose overlapped. VE 14–150 days and >150 days after a second dose was 83% and 37%, respectively. VE 7–120 days and >120 days after a third dose was 60%and 29%, respectively. VE 7–120 days after the fourth dose was 61%. Protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalization waned even after a third dose. The newly authorized bivalent COVID-19 vaccines include mRNA from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and from shared mRNA components between BA.4 and BA.5 lineages and are expected to be more immunogenic against BA.4/BA.5 than monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (6–8). All eligible adults aged ≥18 years§ should receive a booster dose, which currently consists of a bivalent mRNA vaccine, to maximize protection against BA.4/BA.5 and prevent COVID-19–associated hospitalization. 

During December 26, 2021–August 31, 2022, adults aged ≥18 years admitted for COVID-19–like illness¶ within the IVY Network of 21 hospitals in 18 states were eligible for inclusion in this test-negative, case-control analysis. Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19–like illness, case-patients received a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or antigen test result within 14 days of illness onset and control-patients received a negative SARS-CoV-2 NAAT result. Upper respiratory specimens were collected from all enrolled patients and tested by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at a central laboratory (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee). Specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 were sent to the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan) for whole genome sequencing to determine SARS-CoV-2 lineages.** Periods of lineage predominance were defined based on when >50% of sequenced specimens within the IVY Network represented a particular lineage. 

Demographic and clinical data were obtained through electronic medical record (EMR) review and patient (or proxy) interview. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination status was verified from EMRs, state-based registries, vaccination cards, or self-report and adjudicated based on vaccination dates. Four vaccination groups were defined: 1) patients who received no vaccine doses before illness onset, 2) patients who received 2 doses of a monovalent mRNA vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset, 3) patients who received 3 doses of a monovalent mRNA vaccine ≥7 days before illness onset, and 4) patients who received 4 doses of a monovalent mRNA vaccine ≥7 days before illness onset. Patients were excluded if they had an immunocompromising condition,†† had an incomplete vaccination series, or had received a non-mRNA vaccine.§§ 

VE to prevent COVID-19–associated hospitalization was estimated by comparing the odds of antecedent monovalent mRNA vaccination (2, 3, or 4 doses) versus no previous vaccination between case-patients and control-patients. Using multivariable logistic regression models, VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted odds ratio [aOR]) × 100. Models were adjusted for U.S. Department of Health and Human Services region, calendar time in biweekly intervals, age group (18–49, 50–64, and ≥65 years), sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) ethnicity. Results were stratified by periods of Omicron variant predominance (i.e., December 26, 2021–June 19, 2022 [BA.1/BA.2 period] and June 20–August 31, 2022 [BA.4/BA.5 period]), and by days since the last monovalent vaccine dose (14–150 days versus >150 days for 2 doses and 7–120 versus >120 days for 3 or 4 doses to align with previous guidance for next dose eligibility).¶¶ Differences with nonoverlapping 95% CIs were considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using Stata (version 17; StataCorp). This activity was determined to be public health surveillance by each participating site and CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*** 

During December 26, 2021–August 31, 2022, a total of 6,599 immunocompetent patients were enrolled in the IVY Network, and 4,730 (72%) adult patients were included in the analysis (Table 1) (Figure). (A total of 1,869 patients were excluded from this analysis for the following reasons: non-mRNA vaccine receipt [390]; partially vaccinated [158]; implausible or unverified vaccination dates [632]; received vaccination before CDC recommendations [169]; illness onset >10 days before test date [125]; illness onset >14 days before hospitalization [12]; missing data [274]; withdrew [nine]; other [100].) Among the 4,730 patients included, 3,352 (71%) were enrolled during the BA.1/BA.2 period (1,699 case-patients and 1,653 control-patients) and 1,378 (29%) during the BA.4/BA.5 period (707 case-patients and 671 control-patients). 

Case-patients’ median ages during the BA.1/BA.2 period and the BA.4/BA.5 period were 65 and 69 years, respectively. Among patients enrolled during the BA.1/BA.2 period, 1,144 (34%) were unvaccinated, 1,016 (30%) had received 2 doses, 1,126 (34%) had received 3 doses, and 66 (2%) had received 4 doses. Among 1,378 patients included during the BA.4/BA.5 period, 369 (27%) were unvaccinated, 329 (24%) had received 2 doses, 510 (37%) had received 3 doses, and 170 (12%) had received 4 doses. 

During the BA.1/BA.2 period, the overall VE of 3 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine doses against COVID-19–associated hospitalization (median interval between the last dose and illness onset = 145 days) was 69% (Table 2), and during the BA.4/BA.5 period (median interval between the last dose and illness onset = 233 days) was 31%; whereas overall VE of 2 or 4 doses between lineage periods was similar (39% versus 41% for 2 doses and 61% versus 60% for 4 doses). During the BA.1/BA.2 period, VE of 2 doses waned from 63% at 14–150 days since the second dose to 34% at >150 days, VE of 3 doses waned from 79% at 7–120 days since the last dose to 41% at >120 days, and VE of 4 doses 7–120 days after vaccination was 61%. During the BA.4/BA.5 period, VE estimates of 2 doses 14–150 days and >150 days after the second dose were 83% and 37%, respectively; VE estimates of 3 doses 7–120 days and >120 days from the last dose were 60% and 29%, respectively. VE of 4 doses 7–120 days after vaccination was 61%.","Among immunocompetent adults hospitalized within the IVY Network in 18 states, a monovalent booster dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine had limited overall effectiveness against hospitalization caused by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants, likely because of waning immunity. Waning protection against COVID-19–associated hospitalizations was observed with either 2 or 3 doses of mRNA vaccine during the BA.1/BA.2 period with similar emerging trends during the BA.4/BA.5 periods. These findings demonstrate the importance of staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations through receipt of booster doses, which currently consist of bivalent mRNA vaccines for all eligible adults. 

Three phenomena likely contributed to the lower overall VE estimated for 3 monovalent mRNA doses during the BA.4/BA.5 period compared with VE during the BA.1/BA.2 period. First, waning protection of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19–associated hospitalizations has been shown previously, and the current findings add to this evidence (2,9). Although the analysis was stratified by time since last vaccination during each lineage predominance period, the median interval between receipt of the third dose and illness onset during the BA.4/BA.5 period in this analysis was 233 days compared with 145 days during the BA.1/BA.2 period; thus, the BA.4/BA.5 period disproportionately included patients further removed from vaccination, which likely contributed to the lower VE during this period. Waning immunity between lineage periods was less discernible for 2 doses, likely because the median interval between receipt of the second dose and illness onset during the earliest period in this analysis (i.e., BA.1/BA.2) was 277 days, which might already be past the period during which waning can be demonstrated and instead reflects residual protection of 2 doses against COVID-19 hospitalization. In contrast, waning immunity from 4 doses between lineage periods could not be assessed because the median interval from the fourth dose and illness onset during the BA.1/BA.2 and BA.4/BA.5 periods was 26–69 days, which is too recent to show a decrease in protection against COVID-19 hospitalization. Second, increased immune evasion of BA.4/BA.5 lineages has been shown in neutralization assessments and may contribute to lower VE (10). However, the extent to which reduced neutralization in vitro correlates with reduced protection against severe disease is unknown; available studies have shown mixed results (2–5). A study from South Africa showed no difference in VE of 3 monovalent mRNA vaccine doses against hospitalization during the BA.4/BA.5 period compared with the BA.1/BA.2 period at the same intervals from vaccination, which was corroborated by findings from the United Kingdom showing similar VE against BA.2– or BA.4/BA.5–related hospitalizations (2,3). In contrast, a cohort study in Portugal found reduced protection against severe outcomes during BA.5 predominance (4). This was similar to U.S. findings, which indicated that 3-dose VE against hospitalization was lower during the BA.4/BA.5 period compared with the BA.1 period, although these VE estimates did not account for time after the last vaccine dose (5). Third, infection-induced immunity in the population substantially increased during and after the BA.1 period. National seroprevalence estimates indicate a 1.8-fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections during December 2021–February 2022, with 58% of the U.S. population infected by the end of February 2022.††† Cumulative previous infection during the BA.4/BA.5 period compared with that during the BA.1/BA.2 period likely resulted in a larger proportion of unvaccinated persons having infection-induced immunity during the BA.4/BA.5 period than during the BA.1/BA.2 period; thus, lower VE was observed. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, sample size was insufficient to assess VE varying over time for the BA.2 period separately, resulting in use of a combined BA.1/BA.2 group instead, or to demonstrate substantial waning during the BA.4/BA.5 period. Second, because lineage periods were pooled, the unique contributions of immune evasion associated with each lineage to VE could not be ascertained. Third, because previous infection could not be measured, its effect on VE estimates could only be inferred, not quantified. Finally, follow-up time after the fourth dose to assess waning immunity associated with this dose was insufficient. 

Overall, these findings indicate that by the time BA.4/BA.5 lineages became predominant in the United States, effectiveness of 2 or 3 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccines against COVID-19–associated hospitalization had waned. Augmenting population immunity before the winter season through receipt of an updated bivalent COVID-19 booster is important to maximize protection against the predominant BA.5 lineages and prevent COVID-19–associated hospitalizations.","Corresponding author: Diya Surie, dsurie@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Surie D, Bonnell L, Adams K, et al.

To date, occupationally acquired Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infections in health care personnel (HCP) have been rarely reported during the 2022 multinational outbreak (1,2). This report describes the first reported U.S. case and recommends approaches for preventing occupationally acquired MPXV infections in HCP. 

On July 12, 2022, a Florida county health department (HD) received notification of an emergency department nurse who was exposed to MPXV through a needlestick that occurred earlier that day. While obtaining swabs from a patient with suspected monkeypox, the nurse used a needle to create an opening in the vesicular lesion to facilitate direct contact of the swab with fluid in the lesion. The needlestick occurred when recapping the used needle by hand before disposal; it caused a break in the skin on the index finger through the nurse’s gloved hand, accompanied by a small amount of bleeding. The wound was immediately washed with soap and water and drenched with Betadine antiseptic solution (10% povidone-iodine). The incident was promptly reported to the hospital’s infection control practitioner and occupational health department, and to the county HD. Later that day, the lesion swab collected from the patient by the nurse tested positive for nonvariola Orthopoxvirus using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay at the Florida Department of Health Bureau of Public Health Laboratories reference laboratory; a duplicate swab subsequently tested positive for Clade II (previously known as West African clade) MPXV at CDC using a real-time PCR assay specific for the detection of West African Clade II MPXV. 

Within approximately 15 hours of the incident, the nurse, who had no relevant past medical history or previous orthopoxvirus vaccination, received the first dose of a 2-dose JYNNEOS vaccination series as postexposure prophylaxis. In accordance with CDC guidance (3), the nurse continued to work while asymptomatic and was actively monitored by the hospital infectious disease specialist and the county HD. The nurse wore a surgical mask, consistent with CDC COVID-19 guidance, and chose to wear medical gloves when interacting with patients.† 

Ten days after the exposure, a single skin lesion formed at the site of the needlestick. The nurse immediately began isolating at home and kept the lesion covered until it had crusted over, the scab had fallen off, and a new layer of skin had formed beneath the lesion 19 days later. 

The day after the single small vesicular lesion appeared, it was swabbed and subsequently tested positive by PCR for Orthopoxvirus and MPXV at a commercial laboratory; a duplicate swab tested at the Florida Department of Health Bureau of Public Health Laboratories reference laboratory using PCR was positive for nonvariola Orthopoxvirus. During the next 19 days, the lesion at the needlestick site increased in size (remaining <1 cm in diameter) and became pruritic, deep-seated, and umbilicated, then scabbed over and a new layer of skin formed under the scab. Apart from this single lesion at the puncture site, no additional lesions or other clinical signs or symptoms were reported, and tecovirimat was not indicated.§ No secondary cases were identified. 

This report describes the first occupationally acquired MPVX infection in a U.S. health care worker during the 2022 monkeypox outbreak. CDC advises against unroofing, opening, or aspirating¶ (4) monkeypox lesions with sharp instruments (e.g., needles) and recapping used needles** because of the risk for sharps injuries. During the current outbreak, MPXV PCR testing cycle threshold values from swabbed skin and mucosal lesion specimens have been very low, indicating that surface swabbing collects sufficient amounts of viral material without a need to unroof lesions. Because of the reliability and sensitivity of real-time PCR assays used (4,5), vigorous swabbing of the outer surface of a lesion is adequate to collect enough viral material for testing and will minimize the potential for needlesticks. Employers should ensure that HCP are trained in proper specimen collection methods, follow recommended infection prevention and control precautions for the care of patients with monkeypox, and implement safety practices for managing sharps†† if they are used during other aspects of patient care. HCP with exposures should be evaluated promptly to ensure postexposure recommendations are implemented (3). As of October 6, 2022, among 326§§ HCP in Florida who have been occupationally exposed to patients with monkeypox during the 2022 outbreak, only this HCP with a reported needlestick exposure developed a clinical MPXV infection. Overall, with routine adherence to standard infection control practices, among U.S. HCP with nonpercutaneous exposure to monkeypox patients, the risk for acquiring monkeypox appears to be low (6).",N/A,"Corresponding author: Julia Petras, jpetras@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Mendoza R, Petras JK, Jenkins P, et al.

What is already known about this topic? 

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor mental health and suicidal behaviors. 

What is added by this report? 

The prevalences of poor current mental health and past-year suicide attempts among adolescents reporting four or more ACEs during the COVID-19 pandemic were four and 25 times as high as those without ACEs, respectively. Exposure to specific ACE types (e.g., emotional abuse) were associated with higher prevalences of poor mental health and suicidal behaviors. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Primary prevention and intervention strategies for ACEs and their acute and long-term impacts, including early identification and trauma-informed mental health service and support provision, could help address the U.S. child and adolescent mental health and suicide crisis.

Social and educational disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated concerns about adolescents’ mental health and suicidal behavior. Data from the 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES) indicate that 37.1% of U.S. high school students reported poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 19.9% considering and 9.0% attempting suicide in the preceding year (1). Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)* are associated with poor mental health and suicidal behaviors (2,3), and high prevalence of some ACEs have been documented during the pandemic (4). ACEs are preventable, potentially traumatic events that occur in childhood (ages 0–17 years) such as neglect, experiencing or witnessing violence, or having a family member attempt or die by suicide. Also included are aspects of a child’s environment that can undermine their sense of safety, stability, and bonding. Associations between ACEs occurring during the pandemic and mental health or suicidal behaviors among U.S. high school students were examined using ABES data. Experience of one to two ACEs was associated with poorer mental health and increased suicidal behaviors, and these deleterious outcomes increased with additional ACE exposure. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, adolescents who reported four or more ACEs during the pandemic had a prevalence of poor current mental health four times as high as, and a prevalence of past-year suicide attempts 25 times as high as, those without ACEs during the pandemic. Experience of specific ACE types (e.g., emotional abuse) was associated with higher prevalences of poor mental health and suicidal behaviors. Prevention and intervention strategies (5), including early identification and trauma-informed mental health service and support provision, for ACEs and their acute and long-term impacts could help address the U.S. child and adolescent mental health and suicide crisis.† 

The voluntary, probability-based online ABES used stratified, three-stage cluster sampling to obtain nationally representative data from U.S. public and private high school students in grades 9–12 during January–June 2021§ (1,4). Prevalence estimates for some ACEs, mental health, and suicidal behaviors have been reported previously (1,4). Students self-reported experiences of some adversities during the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., emotional abuse, physical abuse, parent or caregiver job loss, and food insecurity) or during the past 12 months¶ (i.e., sexual violence by any perpetrator, physical teen dating violence, and electronic bullying), as well as their mental health (i.e., current poor mental health, poor mental health during the pandemic, and persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year) and suicidal behaviors (i.e., seriously considering suicide, making a suicide plan, or attempting suicide during the past year) (Supplementary Box, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121661). 

The analysis was restricted to 4,390 high school students aged <18 years with complete data on analytic variables, to align with the ACEs focus. ACEs were examined by type (e.g., emotional abuse), category (e.g., exposure to either of the two abuse-related ACEs), and cumulative number of ACEs (zero, one to two, three, and four or more). Weighted pairwise prevalence estimates and 95% CIs for reported ACE exposure by poor mental health or suicidal behaviors were calculated. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using Poisson regression with robust SEs to examine associations between reported ACE exposure during the pandemic and mental health or suicidal behaviors, with and without inclusion of other ACEs. aPRs were adjusted for sex, grade in school, race and ethnicity, sexual identity, and method of school instruction at recruitment into ABES; 95% CIs that excluded 1.0 were considered statistically significant. The ABES study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at CDC and ICF International, CDC’s survey contractor.** Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.4, SAS Institute), accounting for complex survey design. 

Nearly three quarters (73.1%) of high school students aged <18 years reported at least one ACE during the COVID-19 pandemic (53.2%, 12.0%, and 7.8% reported one to two, three, and four or more ACEs, respectively (mean = 1.47; SE = 0.04). Compared with adolescents without ACEs, adolescents who reported one to two ACEs during the pandemic had higher prevalences of poor mental health and suicidal behaviors (aPR range = 1.97–2.39 and 3.29–5.92, respectively) (Table 1). A dose-response relationship between accumulating exposure to ACEs during the pandemic and poor mental health and suicidal behaviors was observed (Figure). Compared with adolescents without ACEs, adolescents with four or more ACEs during the pandemic had a prevalence of poor mental health three to four times as high (aPR range = 3.04–4.06) as well as substantially higher prevalences of past-year suicidal behaviors (seriously considering suicide: 57.4% versus 5.3%, aPR = 7.06, 95% CI = 5.02–9.93; making a suicide plan: 48.6% versus 3.7%, aPR = 8.27, 95% CI = 5.09–13.42; attempted suicide: 38.7% versus 0.9%, aPR = 25.06, 95% CI = 11.35–55.30), after adjusting for demographic characteristics (Table 1). 

After adjusting for demographic characteristics, experience of each ACE type was associated with a higher prevalence of current poor mental health (aPR range = 1.26–2.22), poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (aPR range = 1.28–1.87), and past-year persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness (aPR range = 1.21–1.94) (Table 2). The prevalence of poor mental health among adolescents who reported specific types of ACEs was high. For example, 82.7% and 82.0% who experienced past-year sexual violence or physical teen dating violence, respectively, felt persistently sad or hopeless. Likewise, exposure to each ACE type was associated with a higher prevalence of seriously considering suicide (aPR range = 1.23–3.13), making a suicide plan (aPR range = 1.74–3.62 [except for parent or caregiver job loss]), and attempting suicide in the past year (aPR range = 1.45–5.42). Suicidal behavior prevalence by each ACE type was high; for example, 33.0% of adolescents who experienced any sexual violence during the past year reported attempting suicide. After adjusting for all other assessed ACEs and demographic characteristics, emotional abuse was most strongly associated with poor mental health (aPRs for poor current mental health, poor mental health during the pandemic, and past-year persistent sadness or hopelessness were 1.96, 1.68, and 1.73, respectively) and past-year suicidal behaviors (aPRs for having seriously considered suicide, made a suicide plan, and attempted suicide were 2.61, 2.89, and 3.62, respectively). Experience of any abuse-related ACEs during the pandemic was more strongly associated with mental health and suicidal behaviors than was experience of other forms of violence or family economic pressures (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121662).","Nearly three of every four U.S. high school students reported at least one ACE, and one in 13 (7.8%) reported four or more ACEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparable prepandemic estimates of cumulative ACE exposure among U.S. adolescents are limited; estimates derived from prepandemic, retrospectively collected data among U.S. adults indicate that 60.9% reported at least one, and 15.6% reported four or more ACEs before age 18 years (2). Nevertheless, ACEs were common among U.S. adolescents during the pandemic and often resulted in acute consequences for mental health and suicidal behaviors, even among some adolescents who reported one to two ACEs. Consistent with literature indicating a dose-response relationship between ACEs and poor outcomes (2,3), after adjusting for demographic characteristics, the prevalences of poor current mental health and of past-year suicide attempts among adolescents who reported four or more ACEs during the COVID-19 pandemic were four and 25 times as high as those with no reported ACEs during the pandemic, respectively. The magnitude of effect associated with past-year suicide attempts is particularly concerning, given that a 2019 meta-analysis examining the association between having four or more ACEs and attempting suicide was considerably lower, albeit compelling (i.e., aOR = 7.3) (3). Differences in survey methods, ACEs assessed, exposure periods, and respondent age necessitate caution when comparing estimates. The findings of the current analysis are consistent with studies documenting the negative impacts of specific types of ACEs, including child abuse and neglect (6), sexual violence (7), teen dating violence (7), bullying (7), and family economic pressures (8). After considering demographic characteristics and ACEs assessed, emotional abuse was most strongly associated with poor mental health and suicidal behaviors. This finding is consistent with literature indicating that, although all forms of abuse contribute to adolescent suicidal behaviors, emotional abuse might be relatively more harmful (9). 

General ABES limitations have been documented previously†† (1,4). The findings in this report are subject to five additional limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of the data does not permit causal inferences in associations and might not account for all other factors affecting adolescent mental health or suicidal behaviors. Second, only seven ACEs were included in this analysis; inclusion of more ACEs§§ might have altered the ACE score distribution and which ACEs were most associated with mental health or suicidal behaviors. Third, this analysis did not directly assess experiences of or the impact of the pandemic, and instead included ACEs that adolescents commonly experience, including during the pandemic. Fourth, data on lifetime childhood exposure to ACEs were not available and might exacerbate or alter effects on mental health and suicidal behaviors for exposed children. Finally, the prevalences of some ACEs (e.g., teen dating violence), when comparable data are available, were lower in ABES¶¶ than 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey national estimates,*** possibly related to differences in methodology or behavior patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. These differences could result in misclassification of ACEs exposure and have a potential impact on the strength of observed associations. 

Concerns about poor adolescent mental health and suicidal behaviors preceded the COVID-19 pandemic (10) but escalated during the pandemic. For more than a decade, suicide has been the second or third leading cause of death among adolescents aged 14–18 years.††† This analysis highlights the ongoing, urgent need to address adversity experienced before and during the pandemic to mitigate its impact on mental and behavioral health. CDC’s comprehensive approach to ACEs prevention and intervention emphasizes actions to create the structural and social environments that help children and families thrive, including bolstering family economic supports, supporting a strong start for children, and connecting youth and parents to community- and school-based resources§§§,¶¶¶ (5). Comprehensive, cross-sector approaches, partnerships, and policies focused on primary ACE****,†††† and suicide§§§§ prevention and intervention, including those focusing on early identification, linkage to care,¶¶¶¶ and access to trauma-informed services and supports, are necessary to improve adolescent mental and behavioral health.","Corresponding author: Kayla N.

Among Hispanic persons with HIV, HIV stigma was highest among women (median stigma score = 35.6 of 100) and American Indian or Alaska Native persons (median stigma score = 32.7); health care discrimination was experienced more frequently by men than by women (23% vs. 18%) and by Black or African American Hispanic persons than by White Hispanic persons (28% vs. 21%). 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Culturally appropriate efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination among Hispanic persons with HIV should consider disparities by gender and race.

Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons with HIV experience disparities in HIV health outcomes compared with some other racial and ethnic groups. A previous report found that the percentages of Hispanic persons who received HIV care, were retained in care, and were virally suppressed were lower than those among non-Hispanic White persons with HIV (1). HIV stigma and discrimination are human rights issues associated with adverse HIV outcomes; eliminating stigma and discrimination among persons with HIV is a national priority*,†,§ (2,3). CDC analyzed data from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP), an annual, cross-sectional study designed to report nationally representative estimates of experiences and outcomes among adults with diagnosed HIV. Data from the 2018–2020 cycles were analyzed to assess self-reported stigma and health care discrimination using adapted versions of validated multi-component scales among 2,690 adult Hispanic persons with HIV in the United States overall and by six characteristics.¶ The median HIV stigma score on a scale of 0–100 was 31.7, with women (35.6) and American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons (38.9) reporting the highest scores among Hispanic persons with HIV. HIV stigma was primarily attributed to disclosure concerns (e.g., fearing others will disclose one’s HIV status and being careful about who one tells about one’s HIV status). Nearly one in four (23%) Hispanic persons with HIV experienced health care discrimination. Health care discrimination was experienced more frequently by Hispanic men (23%) than by Hispanic women (18%) and by Black or African American (Black) Hispanic persons (28%) than by White Hispanic persons (21%). Understanding disparities in experiences of stigma and discrimination is important when designing culturally appropriate interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination. 

MMP uses a two-stage sampling method. First, in 2004, out of all U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 16 states and Puerto Rico were sampled**,†† (4). Second, a simple random sample of adults with diagnosed HIV is selected annually from each participating jurisdiction in the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS), a census of persons with diagnosed HIV in the United States. During the 2018–2020 data cycles, data were collected through telephone or in-person interviews. Response rates for the two data cycles were 100% (jurisdictions) and 40%–45% (individual respondents). HIV stigma was measured using an adapted version of a validated 10-item scale that measures four dimensions of HIV stigma: 1) personalized stigma (consequences of other people knowing their status), 2) disclosure concerns, 3) negative self-image (not feeling as good as others and experiencing shame or guilt), and 4) public attitudes (what people think about HIV)§§ (5). Responses (strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, neutral, somewhat agree, and strongly agree) for each item were given scores of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10, respectively, and summed to a score ranging from zero (no stigma) to 100 (high stigma). HIV health care discrimination during the previous 12 months was assessed based on seven forms of discrimination, using an adapted version of a validated Likert scale¶¶ (6). Participants who reported experiencing at least one form of health care discrimination were considered to have experienced discrimination in an HIV health care setting; those who experienced any discrimination were asked whether they attributed discrimination to any of six characteristics.*** 

HIV stigma and health care discrimination were assessed overall and by the following demographic characteristics: gender, race,††† Hispanic origin,§§§ country or region of birth,¶¶¶ and English proficiency.**** Analyses were weighted to adjust for individual nonresponse and poststratified to match the actual number of persons with diagnosed HIV in NHSS by age, race and ethnicity, and gender. Median scores and 95% CIs (using t distribution) were calculated to assess HIV stigma; nonoverlapping CIs determined meaningful differences among groups. Prevalence ratios (PRs) with predicted marginal means were used to quantify differences by characteristics; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11.0.1; RTI International). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal laws and CDC policy.†††† 

Among Hispanic persons with HIV (2,690), 81% were male, 66% identified as White, 13% identified as Black, and 4% identified as AI/AN (Table 1). Thirty-six percent identified Hispanic origin as Mexican, Mexican American, or Chicano; 34% identified Hispanic origin as Puerto Rican. Nearly two thirds (62%) were born outside the continental United States, 22% were born in Puerto Rico, and 19% in Mexico; 42% had limited English proficiency. 

The overall median HIV stigma score among Hispanic persons with HIV was 31.7 (Table 2). HIV stigma was higher among Hispanic women (median = 35.6) than among Hispanic men (median = 30.3) and was also high among Hispanic persons with HIV who identified as AI/AN (median = 38.9) and those who were born in the Caribbean (median = 35.7) (Table 2). Disclosure concerns and perceived public attitudes about persons with HIV were the most reported HIV stigma domains. Forty-eight percent to 78% of persons with HIV strongly agreed with the two items about disclosure concerns, and 20%–28% strongly agreed with the two items about perceived public attitudes (Figure 1) (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121706). 

Overall, 22.6% of Hispanic persons with HIV reported experiencing any HIV health care discrimination during the previous 12 months (Table 2); 8% reported one, 4% reported two, and 11% reported three or more health care discrimination experiences (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121707). Among those who experienced health care discrimination, 62% felt that a doctor or nurse was not listening to what they were saying, 48% felt they were treated with less respect than others, and 48% perceived they were treated with less courtesy than others (Figure 2). Thirty percent attributed health care discrimination to their HIV infection, 23% to their sexual orientation or sexual practices, and 20% to their race or ethnicity (Figure 2). 

Hispanic women were less likely to experience health care discrimination than were Hispanic men (PR = 0.8 Table 2). Black (PR = 1.3) and multiracial Hispanic persons were more likely than White Hispanic persons to experience health care discrimination (PR = 1.4). Non-U.S.–born persons (PR = 0.8) were less likely to experience health care discrimination than U.S.-born persons. Specifically, persons born in Mexico (PR = 0.6), Central America (PR = 0.6), and South America (PR = 0.6) were less likely to experience health care discrimination than U.S.-born persons. Persons with limited English proficiency (PR = 0.6) were less likely to experience health care discrimination than their counterparts. 

","HIV stigma and discrimination experiences in an HIV health care setting were commonly reported among Hispanic persons with HIV and varied by characteristics such as race, gender, and English proficiency. Hispanic persons with HIV are highly diverse. Efforts to reduce HIV stigma and discrimination should consider the varied and unique experiences of this population. 

Similar to experiences reported by all U.S. persons with HIV, the most prevalent HIV stigma domain among Hispanic persons with HIV was concern about disclosure of HIV status (2), and the most reported form of health care discrimination was feeling that a clinician was not listening to them (3). This underscores the importance of addressing disclosure concerns when designing interventions to reduce HIV stigma. Training for providers should focus on actively listening to patient concerns, including stigma experiences, using culturally and linguistically appropriate methods.§§§§ 

Although HIV stigma was more commonly reported by Hispanic women than men, women experienced lower levels of health care discrimination. This contrasts with a study of Hispanic adults that found Latino men were less likely to report health care discrimination than women (7). The present study indicates that stigma and health care discrimination, although related, are distinct concepts experienced differently by Hispanic men and women. Given that more Hispanic men with HIV than women identified as gay or bisexual, these health care discrimination findings could also be based on sexual orientation. 

Black Hispanic persons with HIV were more likely than White Hispanic persons with HIV to report health care discrimination. Though not equivalent to racial identity, some Hispanic persons use skin color to select a racial identity category. Health care discrimination experienced by Hispanic persons might differ based on skin color, with one study finding that Hispanic persons with darker skin experienced greater health care discrimination than those with lighter skin (8). Another study found that U.S.-born Hispanic persons experienced more day-to-day discrimination than non-U.S.–born Hispanic persons (9). Others have found that U.S.-born racial and ethnic minority groups have greater awareness of race-based discrimination than do non-U.S.–born persons, perhaps because race and ethnicity are experienced differently in different countries (9,10). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, MMP data are self-reported and subject to recall and social desirability bias. Second, the interview only captured discrimination in HIV health care settings, excluding persons not in care and not capturing other forms of discrimination. 

This study underscores disparities in HIV stigma and health care discrimination experiences of Hispanic persons with HIV and the need to tailor HIV care efforts. Eliminating stigma and discrimination is a national priority and will require person-, provider-, facility-, and community-level interventions. Provider-focused trainings, policies, and practices are needed to address HIV stigma and discrimination experienced by Hispanic persons with HIV. Trauma-informed approaches to HIV care and treatment might reduce discrimination in HIV care settings by creating feelings of safety, empowerment, and trust among patients while moving beyond cultural biases and stereotypes.¶¶¶¶ HIV care providers should also maintain cultural and linguistic competency. Community-level interventions include supporting organizations that reflect the Hispanic population and increase access to HIV care and leveraging campaigns such as CDC’s Let’s Stop HIV Together (Detengamos Juntos el VIH).***** 

Data disaggregation among Hispanic persons with HIV revealed disparities in stigma and discrimination experiences. Designing multilevel, culturally, and linguistically appropriate approaches that address stigma and discrimination, particularly among priority populations such as Hispanic persons with HIV, is key to improving care and treatment outcomes and ending the HIV epidemic.","Corresponding author: Mabel Padilla, mpadilla@cdc.gov, 404-639-8013.","Suggested citation for this article: Padilla M, Patel D, Beer L, et al.

Misuse of antihistamines has been documented primarily in adolescents and young adults (2); however, antihistamine involvement in overdose deaths has not been widely studied. Among the various antihistamine subtypes, the first-generation H1 subtype can cause anticholinergic effects, including strong sedation (3) that might be exacerbated when co-used with other sedative drugs (e.g., opioids).* Diphenhydramine, a common over-the-counter first-generation H1 antihistamine, has been combined with opioids as an adulterant† in illicit drug supply (4) and can be used to reduce opioid-related side effects (e.g., itchy skin because of histamine release from opioid use).

To describe unintentional and undetermined intent overdose deaths with antihistamine positivity, involvement, or both, CDC analyzed available 2019–2020 data from the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) in 43 states and the District of Columbia.§,¶ A death was defined as antihistamine-positive if any antihistamine was detected on postmortem toxicology or was listed as a cause of death on the death certificate.** A death was defined as antihistamine-involved if the drug class was listed as a cause of death on the death certificate (i.e., antihistamine-involved is a subset of antihistamine-positive). Descriptive data for deaths are presented by sex, age, race and ethnicity, U.S. Census Bureau region,†† and other drugs involved. Analyses were restricted to decedents for whom postmortem toxicology results were available.§§

Among 92,033 overdose deaths during 2019–2020, 13,574 (14.7%) were antihistamine-positive and 3,345 (3.6%) were antihistamine-involved; fewer than 0.1% (90) involved antihistamines alone (Table). Nearly all antihistamine-positive and -involved deaths (13,475, 99.6%; 3,339, 99.8%, respectively) included first-generation H1 antihistamines, primarily diphenhydramine (9,645, 71.1%; 2,226, 66.5%, respectively). The proportions of antihistamine- and diphenhydramine-involved overdose deaths were highest for females (52.0%; 52.8%), persons aged 35–44 years (26.1%; 26.5%), and White, non-Hispanic persons (78.1%; 78.7%); demographic patterns of antihistamine- and diphenhydramine-positive deaths were similar, except that deaths were more frequent among males (57.8%; 59.6%) and in the Midwest region (43.6%; 51.0%). Most antihistamine- and diphenhydramine-involved overdose deaths co-involved opioids (82.8% and 82.7%, respectively), primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs)¶¶ (5).

Nearly 15% of overdose deaths during 2019–2020 were antihistamine-positive, and 4% were antihistamine-involved; only 90 deaths involved antihistamines as the sole drug. Most antihistamine-positive and antihistamine-involved deaths included diphenhydramine, which is easily accessible over the counter as an allergy medication and sleep aid. Antihistamine-involved deaths commonly co-involved opioids; this might be partly attributable to adulteration of the illicit opioid supply with antihistamines, in particular diphenhydramine, which can be dangerous because of potentially combined sedative effects. Naloxone administration is important for any overdose with suspected opioid involvement. Because antihistamines do not respond to naloxone, co-involved opioid and antihistamine overdoses might require naloxone administration plus other immediate medical response measures to prevent death.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, results included 44 jurisdictions and might not be nationally representative. Second, drug testing methods are not standardized across jurisdictions, which might limit interpretation of results. Antihistamine-positivity could reflect use to treat allergy or other symptoms rather than misuse. It is also possible that some persons did not knowingly consume antihistamines and were exposed to these drugs through adulteration of the illicit drug supply with antihistamines. Despite these limitations, these data highlight the importance of continued surveillance to understand the drugs and drug combinations contributing to overdose deaths and to guide awareness efforts about the potential dangers of the unpredictable illicit drug supply and the intentional or unintentional co-use of substances, including antihistamines and opioids.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Amanda T.

During this period, measured chemical concentrations of microcystins (a class of cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria) in the water of the Lower and Oaks arms of Clear Lake were persistently above the California recreational “Danger” health advisory level of 20 μg/L (1). A maximum microcystin detection of 160,378 μg/L was measured at a beach in the city of Clearlake in September 2021 (2). Microcystins are potent hepatotoxins and can cause gastroenteritis, dermatitis, and allergic reactions (3). The 17 local public drinking water systems with source lake water intakes in Clear Lake monitored and managed their systems with frequent testing, adjustment of treatment, and other measures to ensure that microcystins in finished drinking water did not exceed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drinking water health advisory of 0.3 μg/L (4). However, an unknown number of homes around Clear Lake relied on private water systems with lake water intakes or wells, and the quality of the private drinking water at those homes was unknown.

To address this uncertainty, the California Water: Assessment of Toxins for Community Health (Cal-WATCH) project collected and analyzed tap water samples for cyanotoxins from households with private lake water intakes and private wells located ≤50 ft (15.2 m) of the lake. To identify potentially eligible homes, parcel maps of lakefront land were overlaid with built structure and water system boundary maps of all 17 local public drinking water systems. Staff members from the Big Valley Rancheria Environmental Protection Department visually inspected the shoreline by boat to identify potential lake water intakes. A total of 493 parcels with structures that were not within the boundary of any public water system or that had a visible lake water intake were identified. Outreach to homeowners included postcards, door hangers, and knocking on doors. Broader community outreach was also conducted via social media and local earned media. This study was reviewed and approved by the Public Health Institute Institutional Review Board.*

Forty-six eligible homeowners enrolled in the study, and study staff members collected questionnaires and at least one water sample from each home during June to November 2021. Microcystins were not detected in the tap water of any homes with near-shore wells; however, several water samples had cyanobacteria visible on microscopy, potentially indicating lake water intrusion. Six out of the 15 well owners did not have filtration systems. In contrast, microcystins were detected in the tap water of 22 of the 31 homes with lake water intakes (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121659). In 18 of these homes, the level of microsystin concentration was at or above the EPA drinking water health advisory level of 0.3 μg/L (maximum = 3.9 μg/L). All 31 private lake water intakes had some type of filtration; of these, 27 also had one or more forms of prefiltration treatment, including chlorination, ultraviolet disinfection, or ozone treatment (Table). Chlorination or other treatment could lyse cyanobacteria cells, releasing cyanotoxins. Although the sampling team did not inspect the treatment systems, homeowners mentioned difficulties with setup and ongoing maintenance and testing; even well-maintained systems might have been overwhelmed by the high concentrations of microcystins in the source water.

On September 15, 2021, based on the Cal-WATCH findings and the increasing severity of HABs in the lake, the local health officer issued an emergency “Do Not Drink” advisory for private lake water drinking systems.† State, local, and tribal governments coordinated with nearby public water systems to provide free drinking water filling stations for the affected population. The local health officer lifted the advisory on November 16, 2021, when levels of microcystins in most lake water samples had declined below “Danger” advisory levels.§ Residents were advised to flush their systems, have them professionally inspected, and have filters changed before any household use; drinking water fill stations remained open.

The frequency of HABs in drinking water sources might increase because of climate change.¶ During a freshwater HAB event, households with private lake water intakes are at high risk of cyanotoxin contamination. Frequent monitoring for early detection of HABs, partnerships across agencies for public health response, emergency alerts, and provision of alternative drinking water are short-term solutions. Longer-term solutions include transitioning homes to public water systems and ongoing public education about HABs. Research into other strategies to mitigate HABs, including reduction of nutrient runoff, revegetation of shorelines, and aeration, might offer additional long-term prevention opportunities (5).",N/A,"Corresponding author: Gina M.

Acute respiratory illness (ARI) caused by viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) results in pediatric morbidity. 

What is added by this report? 

Rhinovirus and enterovirus and RSV were the most frequently detected viruses among children enrolled in the New Vaccine Surveillance Network during 2016–2021 through inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department settings. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, respiratory viruses exhibited uncharacteristic seasonality, with lower-than-expected circulation during April 2020–May 2021, and atypical RSV circulation and inpatient enrollment in summer 2021. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Continued ARI surveillance is critical as vaccines and therapeutics are introduced to protect children from SARS-CoV-2 and RSV to elucidate risk factors, health disparities, and to guide prevention policies.

The New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) is a prospective, active, population-based surveillance platform that enrolls children with acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) at seven pediatric medical centers. ARIs are caused by respiratory viruses including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), and most recently SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), which result in morbidity among infants and young children (1–6). NVSN estimates the incidence of pathogen-specific pediatric ARIs and collects clinical data (e.g., underlying medical conditions and vaccination status) to assess risk factors for severe disease and calculate influenza and COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness. Current NVSN inpatient (i.e., hospital) surveillance began in 2015, expanded to emergency departments (EDs) in 2016, and to outpatient clinics in 2018. This report describes demographic characteristics of enrolled children who received care in these settings, and yearly circulation of influenza, RSV, HMPV, HPIV1–3, adenovirus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus (RV/EV),* and SARS-CoV-2 during December 2016–August 2021. Among 90,085 eligible infants, children, and adolescents (children) aged <18 years† with ARI, 51,441 (57%) were enrolled, nearly 75% of whom were aged <5 years; 43% were hospitalized. Infants aged <1 year accounted for the largest proportion (38%) of those hospitalized. The most common pathogens detected were RV/EV and RSV. Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, detected respiratory viruses followed previously described seasonal trends, with annual peaks of influenza and RSV in late fall and winter (7,8). After the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and implementation of associated pandemic nonpharmaceutical interventions and community mitigation measures, many respiratory viruses circulated at lower-than-expected levels during April 2020–May 2021. Beginning in summer 2021, NVSN detected higher than anticipated enrollment of hospitalized children as well as atypical interseasonal circulation of RSV. Further analyses of NVSN data and continued surveillance are vital in highlighting risk factors for severe disease and health disparities, measuring the effectiveness of vaccines and monoclonal antibody–based prophylactics, and guiding policies to protect young children from pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV. 

During December 1, 2016–August 31, 2021, NVSN enrolled children aged <18 years in inpatient and ED settings at seven surveillance sites (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121550). Children were eligible for enrollment if they had an illness duration of <14 days, were enrolled within 48 hours of admission (inpatient only), had at least one qualifying ARI sign or symptom (e.g., apnea, cough, earache, fever, myalgia, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, vomiting after coughing, shortness of breath [rapid or shallow breathing], wheezing, or apparent life-threatening event or brief resolved unexplained event), and resided in a surveillance site area.§ Children were excluded if they had a known nonrespiratory cause for hospitalization, had fever and neutropenia from chemotherapy, were admitted <5 days after a previous hospitalization, were transferred from another hospital after an admission of >48 hours, were a newborn who had never been discharged home from the hospital, or had previously enrolled in this study <14 days before their current visit or hospitalization. Children could be enrolled in inpatient units ≥5 days per week and in the ED ≥4 days per week for ≥6 hours per day. 

Outpatient clinic enrollment began in November 2018, with enrollment limited to children aged <2 years and testing for RSV only. Enrollment and testing were later expanded to include children aged <18 years and multipathogen testing.¶ Outpatient enrollment was paused during May–October 2019, and weekly enrollment targets of approximately 150 patients were required before July 2020. Outpatient eligibility and exclusion criteria differed slightly from that of other clinical settings.** Beginning in April 2020, outpatient surveillance was expanded in Houston, Texas to include drive-through testing for SARS-CoV-2 (9). Data in this report are summarized by highest level of care received by each child, irrespective of the child’s enrollment setting. 

Midturbinate (MT) nasal or oropharyngeal (OP) specimens were obtained using flocked swabs; if both nasal and OP swabs were collected, they were combined and placed in universal transport medium. A tracheal aspirate was accepted as an alternative specimen for patients who were intubated. Among patients from whom research MT nasal and OP or tracheal aspirate specimens could not be obtained, clinically obtained respiratory specimens were salvaged.†† Specimens were transported to the laboratory at each site and stored at a temperature of 35.6°F–46.4°F (2°C–8°C) until they were processed (within 72 hours). Specimen aliquots were subsequently frozen at −94°F (−70°C) or lower. Specimens underwent molecular testing at each study site for respiratory pathogens including RSV, influenza, HMPV, HPIV1–3, RV/EV, and adenovirus. SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and associated testing methodologies§§ began in 2020.¶¶ Molecular diagnostic assay methods used for respiratory pathogens varied by site (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121551) (Supplementary Table 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121552). All assays met CDC-sponsored proficiency testing standards. 

Pearson’s chi-square tests compared the percentage of positive results during the 2020–2021 season against previous seasons combined, among inpatients and those treated in the ED. All analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal guardian of eligible children before conducting a standardized parent or guardian interview; medical chart review; and collection, testing, and storage of respiratory specimens. Assent from eligible children was obtained at each site, according to local regulations. This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at each of the seven study sites.*** 

During December 2016–August 2021, a total of 90,085 eligible children with ARI were identified and 51,441 (57%) were enrolled. Within the highest clinical care setting received, enrolled children included 22,093 (43%) inpatients, 23,145 (45%) patients evaluated in the ED, and 6,203 (12%) evaluated in outpatient clinics (Table 1). Among all enrolled children, 38,267 (74%) were aged <5 years, 15,986 (42%) of whom were aged <1 year. The majority of enrolled children (55%) were male; 32% were non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), 31% were non-Hispanic White (White) and 27% were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) children. Among hospitalized children, 8,280 (38%) were aged <1 year, 12,623 (57%) were male, and 9,042 (41%) were White. 

Across all settings, 32,259 (63%) specimens had at least one viral pathogen detected, 4,492 (9%) had more than one viral pathogen detected, and 19,182 (37%) had no viral pathogen detected. The pathogens most frequently detected were RV/EV (14,906; 31%) and RSV (8,461; 17%) (Table 2). Total proportions for each virus varied by setting; RSV was detected most frequently in inpatient settings (24%), influenza in EDs (11%), and RV/EV in outpatient clinics (39%). During the COVID-19 pandemic period (March 2020–August 31, 2021), 1,171 (7%) children received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, 411 (35%) of whom were outpatients. During the 2020–2021 season (September 15, 2020–August 31, 2021), lower total proportions of test results were positive for seasonal viruses compared with previous seasons combined among inpatient and ED settings, except for HPIV1–3 (8%) and RV/EV (36%) (p<0.001). Enrollment during December 2016–February 2020, peaked in inpatient and ED settings, with concurrent peaks in RSV and influenza detections. Other viruses such as adenovirus and HMPV circulated throughout this period, but smaller peaks occurred later in winter and early spring (Figure). After onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, inpatient and ED enrollment did not follow previously observed seasonal patterns; enrollment and virus circulation during winter months of 2020 was lower than expected and a distinct peak in RSV circulation and overall enrollment occurred during summer months of 2021.","During 2016–2021, approximately 51,000 children with ARI were prospectively enrolled in NVSN. Nearly 75% of enrolled children were aged <5 years, and children aged <1 year accounted for approximately one third of those hospitalized, consistent with previous studies among this age group (1–5). NVSN enrollees were racially and ethnically diverse, with nearly one third being Black children followed by slightly lower percentages of White and Hispanic children. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, seasonal patterns of respiratory virus circulation followed previously described trends, including annual peaks of influenza and RSV during late fall and winter months (7,8). RV/EV and RSV were the most frequently detected viruses in children in all settings; however, by setting, RSV was more commonly detected among hospitalized children than it was in ED or outpatient clinics. During the 2020–2021 season, the total proportion of seasonal respiratory viruses was lower than that during previous seasons for all except HPIV1–3 and RV/EV. These declines support previous studies, which postulated that community mitigation measures (e.g., school and child care facility closures) during the COVID-19 pandemic had contributed to decreased circulation of respiratory viruses such as influenza and RSV (10). Pandemic period enrollment did not follow seasonal trends, with a notable increase in inpatient and ED enrollments during summer months of 2021. This increase was largely associated with the return of RSV after nearly a year without community circulation. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, NVSN data are limited to enrolled and consented participants who might not be representative of all children seeking care at a healthcare facility. Second, although NVSN surveillance sites are located across the United States, they might not be representative of the entire country. Third, outpatient clinic surveillance differed from the more consistent inpatient and ED surveillance in several ways, including a later start date, prioritized RSV testing during first year of enrollment, paused enrollment during May 2019–October 2019, and age restrictions in several sites, making it difficult to establish trends during the surveillance period. Finally, new approaches to outpatient surveillance (e.g., drive-through clinics) were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected enrollment and proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results in this setting. 

Prospective ARI surveillance in NVSN measured seasonal trends in respiratory virus circulation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data have the potential to estimate population-based rates of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other respiratory virus hospitalizations, ED, and outpatient visits. Further analyses of NVSN data and continued surveillance are vital in highlighting risk factors for severe disease and health disparities, measuring the effectiveness of vaccines and monoclonal antibody–based prophylactics, and guiding policies to protect young children from pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV.","Corresponding author: Ariana Perez, oss0@cdc.gov, 404-718-7378.","Suggested citation for this article: Perez A, Lively JY, Curns A, et al.

During 2020, the number of infections reported to the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) decreased compared with the average reported during 2016–2018. Pandemic-related measures likely decreased occurrence of some infections and limited ascertainment of others. 

What is added by this report? 

During 2021, the number of infections reported to FoodNet decreased 8% compared with the 2016–2018 average, likely related to the pandemic. Most infections were caused by Campylobacter or Salmonella; the five most common Salmonella serotypes remained predominant. Use of culture-independent diagnostic tests increased. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Comprehensive efforts are needed to improve food safety. Substantial progress is needed to achieve national goals, particularly for Salmonella and Campylobacter. Reflex cultures remain essential for surveillance of enteric infections.

To evaluate progress toward prevention of enteric infections in the United States, the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) conducts active population-based surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed infections caused by Campylobacter, Cyclospora, Listeria, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Shigella, Vibrio, and Yersinia at 10 U.S. sites. This report summarizes preliminary 2021 data and describes changes in annual incidence compared with the average annual incidence for 2016–2018, the reference period for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Healthy People 2030 goals for some pathogens (1). During 2021, the incidence of infections caused by Salmonella decreased, incidence of infections caused by Cyclospora, Yersinia, and Vibrio increased, and incidence of infections caused by other pathogens did not change. As in 2020, behavioral modifications and public health interventions implemented to control the COVID-19 pandemic might have decreased transmission of enteric infections (2). Other factors (e.g., increased use of telemedicine and continued increase in use of culture-independent diagnostic tests [CIDTs]) might have altered their detection or reporting (2). Much work remains to achieve HHS Healthy People 2030 goals, particularly for Salmonella infections, which are frequently attributed to poultry products and produce, and Campylobacter infections, which are frequently attributed to chicken products (3). 

FoodNet is a collaboration among CDC, 10 state health departments, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FoodNet’s catchment area (Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, and selected counties in California, Colorado, and New York) includes approximately 15% of the U.S. population (an estimated 50 million persons in 2020). Bacterial infections were diagnosed by culture or CIDT; Cyclospora infections were diagnosed by microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (2). The frequencies of hospitalizations,* deaths,† outbreak-associated infections,§ and international travel–associated infections¶ were calculated overall and by pathogen; unknown results were classified as “no.” Incidence was calculated by dividing the number of laboratory-diagnosed infections in 2021 by 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for the surveillance area. The percentage change in incidence during 2021 compared with the average annual incidence during 2016–2018 was estimated using a new Bayesian, negative binomial model with penalized thin plate splines that adjusted for state-specific trends and changes in population over time (4). 

Surveillance for physician-diagnosed postdiarrheal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of STEC infection, is conducted through a network of nephrologists and infection preventionists and by hospital discharge data review. This report includes HUS cases in children and adolescents aged <18 years for 2020, the most recent year with available data. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.** 

During 2021, FoodNet identified 22,019 infections, 5,359 hospitalizations, and 153 deaths (Table 1). Incidence was highest for Campylobacter (17.8 cases per 100,000 population) and Salmonella (14.2). Overall, 8% fewer infections were reported during 2021 than the average during 2016–2018; incidence decreased for Salmonella, increased for Cyclospora, Vibrio, and Yersinia, and was unchanged for Campylobacter, Listeria, Shigella, and STEC. The percentage of infections resulting in hospitalization and the percentage of outbreak-associated infections were stable. Overall, 7% of infections in 2021 were associated with international travel compared with 13% during 2016–2018 (Figure). 

Two thirds (67%) of bacterial infections were diagnosed using CIDT in 2021, compared with approximately one half (49%) during 2016–2018 (Table 2). In 2021, 37% of bacterial infections were diagnosed using only CIDT (i.e., the specimen had a negative culture result or was not cultured) compared with 26% during 2016−2018. A reflex culture†† was performed for 70% of infections diagnosed by CIDT in 2021, similar to 2016–2018. Reflex culture attempts decreased for Campylobacter, Listeria, STEC, Vibrio, and Yersinia. The percentage of reflex cultures that yielded a pathogen ranged from 24% for Yersinia to 89% for Listeria. 

Among 6,110 Salmonella isolates, 5,442 (89%) were serotyped in 2021. The seven most common serotypes were Enteritidis (908; 17%), Newport (596; 11%), Typhimurium (510; 9%), Javiana (406; 7%), I 4,[5],12:i:- (304; 6%), Oranienburg (247; 5%), and Infantis (232; 4%). Compared with 2016–2018, incidence§§ was higher for Oranienburg (38.6% increase; 95% credible interval [CrI] = 14.2% to 72.1%) and Infantis (23.7%; 95% CrI = 2.9% to 48.7%), lower for I 4,[5],12:i:- (−33.4%; 95% CrI = −45.4% to −17.9%), Typhimurium (−29.2%; 95% CrI = −35.7% to −22.4%), and Enteritidis (−24.7%; 95% CrI = −33.6% to −15.6%), and unchanged for Javiana (−23.0%; 95% CrI = −44.0% to 12.4%) and Newport (−8.7%; 95% CrI = −28.5% to 19.2%). Enteritidis, Newport, Typhimurium, Javiana, and I 4,[5],12:i:- have been among the five most common serotypes since 2010. Infantis has been among the 10 most common since 2013. During 2021, Oranienburg caused a multistate outbreak linked to onions;¶¶ before that, Oranienburg had last been among the 10 most common serotypes in 2009. 

Among 1,203 STEC isolates in 2021, serogroup O157 was most common (314; 26%), followed by O26 (179; 15%), O103 (140; 12%), and O111 (116; 10%). During 2020, FoodNet identified 49 cases of postdiarrheal HUS in children and adolescents aged <18 years (0.4 cases per 100,000), including 21 (43%) in children aged <5 years (0.7 per 100,000). The overall incidence of HUS was similar to that during 2016–2018 (−7.6% change; 95% CrI = −21.1% to 8.4%). The 2020 incidence of STEC O157 infections decreased 16.8% (95% CrI = −25.0% to −9.3%) compared with the average during 2016–2018. Overall, 37 (76%) HUS cases had evidence of STEC infection; 18 of 23 (78%) HUS cases with culture-confirmed STEC infection were serogroup O157.","The 8% decrease in enteric infections reported to FoodNet during 2021 compared with the annual average during 2016–2018 suggests ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously published FoodNet data (2) and other studies using data from 2020 (5–7) support the occurrence of two pandemic-related phenomena: decreased transmission and incidence of enteric infections (i.e., due to pandemic control measures) and underascertainment of infections related to changes in health care–seeking behaviors (e.g., increased use of telemedicine). The relatively low percentage of infections associated with international travel during 2021 (7%) and 2020 (5%) (2) support occurrence of the former. Lifting of pandemic control measures might have contributed to the stable or increased incidence for some pathogens during 2021. The stable percentage of hospitalizations during 2021 suggests that underascertainment was similar to baseline levels. However, the stable incidence of HUS coincident with a decrease in incidence of STEC O157 infections during 2020 suggests that these infections and perhaps others were underascertained; the severity of HUS makes it a more reliable measure (i.e., less affected by changes in health care delivery or health care–seeking behaviors). A better understanding of how pandemic control measures influenced enteric infections might help identify interventions to sustainably decrease their incidence. 

Increasing use of CIDTs complicates the interpretation of surveillance trends, with factors such as test platform and pathogen affecting the accuracy of results. Molecular tests have high sensitivity for many pathogens (8) but might not indicate viable organisms. Variable specificity of CIDTs for FoodNet pathogens can result in false-positive results, most notably for Vibrio (9). Reflex cultures remain essential for public health functions, including determining antibiotic resistance, detecting outbreaks, and determining serotypes. 

Comprehensive efforts are needed to address the root causes of foodborne illness, and substantial progress is needed to achieve HHS Healthy People 2030 goals, particularly for Salmonella and Campylobacter (1). The most recent report from the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration attributed 23% of foodborne Salmonella illnesses to chicken and turkey and 42% to produce items (3). The predominance of five Salmonella serotypes for >10 years emphasizes the need for more robust measures to identify and address Salmonella contamination in food by serotype. In October 2021, USDA-FSIS announced plans for stronger efforts to reduce Salmonella infections associated with poultry products, including before harvest and in slaughter and processing facilities, and began working with a national advisory committee*** (10). Targeted efforts are also needed to address Salmonella contamination of produce and Campylobacter infections from chicken products (3). Improving agricultural water safety, as FDA has proposed,††† might decrease infections with pathogens transmitted commonly by produce, including Salmonella, STEC O157, and Listeria. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, infections resulting from all modes of transmission (i.e., not exclusively foodborne) are included. Second, changes in incidence might not reflect sustained trends, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the percentage of cases with hospitalization, death, and international travel might be underestimated because unknown results were classified as “no”; preliminary 2021 data have a higher percentage of unknown results than do finalized 2016–2018 data. 

FoodNet’s 2021 data demonstrate ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on reported cases of infections transmitted commonly through food. As CIDT use continues to increase, reflex cultures remain essential for public health functions. Identifying novel strategies and implementing known strategies to address the root causes of illness are needed to sustainably decrease infections and achieve HHS Healthy People 2030 goals.","Corresponding author: Jennifer P.

Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) caused biennial outbreaks of severe respiratory illness and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in the United States in 2014, 2016, and 2018. 

What is added by this report? 

After an extended period of low EV-D68 circulation during the COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance data suggest increased detection of rhinovirus/enterovirus and EV-D68, concurrent with increased emergency department visits by children and adolescents with acute respiratory illness and asthma/reactive airway disease during summer 2022. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Clinicians should consider EV-D68 as a possible cause of acute respiratory illness and AFM in children and adolescents this fall and be aware of guidance for prompt testing and referral for patients with suspected AFM.

Increases in severe respiratory illness and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) among children and adolescents resulting from enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infections occurred biennially in the United States during 2014, 2016, and 2018, primarily in late summer and fall. Although EV-D68 annual trends are not fully understood, EV-D68 levels were lower than expected in 2020, potentially because of implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures (e.g., wearing face masks, enhanced hand hygiene, and physical distancing) (1). In August 2022, clinicians in several geographic areas notified CDC of an increase in hospitalizations of pediatric patients with severe respiratory illness and positive rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV) test results.* Surveillance data were analyzed from multiple national data sources to characterize reported trends in acute respiratory illness (ARI), asthma/reactive airway disease (RAD) exacerbations, and the percentage of positive RV/EV and EV-D68 test results during 2022 compared with previous years. These data demonstrated an increase in emergency department (ED) visits by children and adolescents with ARI and asthma/RAD in late summer 2022. The percentage of positive RV/EV test results in national laboratory-based surveillance and the percentage of positive EV-D68 test results in pediatric sentinel surveillance also increased during this time. Previous increases in EV-D68 respiratory illness have led to substantial resource demands in some hospitals and have also coincided with increases in cases of AFM (2), a rare but serious neurologic disease affecting the spinal cord. Therefore, clinicians should consider AFM in patients with acute flaccid limb weakness, especially after respiratory illness or fever, and ensure prompt hospitalization and referral to specialty care for such cases. Clinicians should also test for poliovirus infection in patients suspected of having AFM because of the clinical similarity to acute flaccid paralysis caused by poliovirus. Ongoing surveillance for EV-D68 is critical to ensuring preparedness for possible future increases in ARI and AFM. 

ARI caused by EV-D68 primarily affects young children with varying severity. Typical signs and symptoms include cough, nasal congestion, wheezing, and dyspnea; infection can exacerbate asthma or RAD (1,3,4). Children with a history of asthma/RAD might be more likely to require medical care, although any child with ARI caused by EV-D68 can have severe illness (3,4). Importantly, EV-D68 is associated with AFM, a severe condition that can lead to muscle weakness and paralysis (2). Standard multiplex respiratory panels cannot distinguish between RVs and EVs or identify specific virus types. Thus, EV-D68 cases are likely undercounted because type identification is not routinely performed and reporting is not mandatory.† 

Weekly data from three sources were analyzed for this report. First, weekly ED visits from week 1 of 2018 through week 37 of 2022 by children and adolescents aged <18 years from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) were assessed§; visits with ARI¶ and asthma/RAD** were identified, and quality control filters were applied to allow comparison across years.†† Second, weekly percentages of positive RV/EV test results from week 1 of 2014 through week 35 of 2022 were analyzed from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS),§§ a network of 473 laboratories that passively report aggregated testing data. Third, RV/EV and EV-D68 detections were assessed among children and adolescents aged <18 years who visited an ED or were hospitalized for ARI within the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN)¶¶ during 2017–2022; the weekly percentages of pediatric patients with a positive RV/EV test result who also had a positive EV-D68 test result were characterized. For all platforms, descriptive analyses of longitudinal trends compared with previous years were conducted and stratified by age group and geographic region, where available. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*** 

The percentage of ED visits among children and adolescents aged 0–4 and 5–17 years that were associated with ARI has been qualitatively elevated from week 15 through week 37 of 2022 (the endpoint of available data) compared with 2018–2020; levels were comparable with summer 2021, when respiratory syncytial virus circulation was elevated (Figure 1) (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121524).††† A more recent increase in the percentage of ED visits with ARI began on week 31 among both age groups. The percentage of ED visits associated with asthma/RAD in 2022 among children aged 0–4 years was qualitatively higher in all weeks from week 29 to 37 compared with the corresponding weeks during 2018–2021, and by week 37 had reached levels higher than observed at any other point in 2018–2022, although data from this week are preliminary (Figure 1). Percentages of ED visits with asthma/RAD among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years during these weeks were also qualitatively higher than those during 2020–2021 but were similar to what was reported during 2018–2019 (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121524). These observations were consistent when assessing numbers of ED visits with ARI and asthma/RAD rather than percentages (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121525). By week 37, the percentage of ED visits with asthma/RAD for either age group had exceeded, at some recent point, levels observed at any time during 2018–2021 in most Health and Human Services regions (Supplementary Figure 3, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121526). 

The percentage of positive RV/EV nucleic acid amplification test results in NREVSS has been elevated during late summer and early fall during 2014–2022 except in 2020 (Figure 2), and particularly high rates were noted either in late spring or late summer during years with increased EV-D68 detections in the United States (2014, 2016, and 2018). The weekly percentage of positive RV/EV test results in 2022 appears to be increasing at a rate comparable to that in past EV-D68 outbreak years: the percentage of positive RV/EV test results approximately doubled from week 32 (15.8%) to 35 (31.4%), which was the fourth highest value observed for that week after 2014 (41.5%), 2018 (34.4%), and 2015 (31.7%). 

During March 1–September 20, 2022, NVSN enrolled 5,633 children and adolescents with ARI seeking emergency care or requiring hospitalization. Testing is ongoing; however, as of September 20, 2022, RV/EV was detected in 1,492 (26.4%) of these patients, among whom 260 (17.4%) had a positive EV-D68 test result. The percentage of positive EV-D68 test results among children and adolescents with ARI and positive RV/EV test results increased to 56% during week 32 (Figure 3). The percentage of positive EV-D68 test results during July and August 2022 was higher than that during the same months of 2017 and 2019–2021 and similar to peak levels observed in 2018. The number of EV-D68 detections and rates of increase varied by geographic location of sentinel sites (Supplementary Figure 4, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121527). The median age of the 260 pediatric patients in NVSN with EV-D68 detected was 2.6 years (IQR = 0–15 years), and the most common signs and symptoms were shortness of breath or rapid shallow breathing, wheezing, cough, and nasal congestion.","Using data from three separate surveillance systems, this analysis found an increase in medically attended ARI and asthma/RAD exacerbations in children and adolescents during summer 2022. This rise might be attributable, in part, to increased RV/EV circulation and specifically circulation of EV-D68. In 2014, a widespread EV-D68 outbreak in the United States caused similar increases in medically attended severe respiratory illnesses and asthma exacerbations and was associated with an increase in AFM cases (2,3). Surveillance efforts for EV-D68 were enhanced after this outbreak, including the establishment of active, prospective sentinel surveillance (2,5,6). The seasonality of EV-D68 and associated AFM cases remains poorly characterized, but biennial peaks occurred in 2014, 2016, and 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic (7). Ongoing surveillance is necessary to understand when and where future circulation and EV-D68–associated severe illness might occur, given the potential changes in virus circulation and population immunity related to COVID-19 mitigation measures (1). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, differences in surveillance catchment populations and representativeness limit direct comparisons across systems and generalizability of findings. Second, delays in reporting vary by system and might result in underestimates of recently reported data. Third, in the ED data, ARI is a broad definition designed to capture all diagnoses related to respiratory illness, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, pneumonia, and cough, potentially limiting specificity for identifying visits with EV-D68-associated respiratory illnesses. Fourth, the COVID-19 pandemic likely affected health care–seeking behaviors and testing practices in multiple ways; these differences could affect comparability of recent data to 2019 and previous years. Finally, comparable NSSP data on hospitalizations or trends before 2018 are unavailable, as are NVSN data before 2017. 

Clinicians are advised to consider EV-D68 as a possible cause of severe respiratory illness in children and adolescents, particularly those with wheezing or who require respiratory support. Health care facilities should be prepared for possible increases in pediatric health care use associated with severe EV-D68–associated respiratory illness (8). Past increases in EV-D68 circulation were also associated with increased reports of AFM.§§§ Providers should have a high index of clinical suspicion for AFM in patients with acute flaccid limb weakness, neurologic signs and symptoms, or neck or back pain who have a recent history of respiratory illness or fever. Children with AFM can experience rapid progression of weakness and should be promptly hospitalized and referred to specialty care.¶¶¶ Given the detection of a paralytic polio case and wastewater samples positive for poliovirus in New York during summer 2022 (9), clinicians should also test for poliovirus infection in patients suspected of having AFM because of the clinical similarity to acute flaccid paralysis caused by poliovirus. Providers should immediately report possible AFM cases and acute flaccid paralysis cases suspected of polio to local and state health departments and coordinate with health departments and CDC for testing protocols.****","Corresponding author: Kevin C.

Real-world monkeypox vaccine performance data are limited in the context of the ongoing monkeypox outbreak. 

What is added by this report? 

Across 32 U.S. jurisdictions, among males aged 18–49 years eligible for JYNNEOS vaccination, monkeypox incidence was 14 times as high among unvaccinated males compared with those who had received a first vaccine dose ≥14 days earlier. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

These early findings suggest that a single JYNNEOS dose provides some protection against monkeypox infection. The degree and durability of such protection is unknown, and it is recommended that persons who are eligible for monkeypox vaccination receive the complete 2-dose series.

Human monkeypox is caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), an Orthopoxvirus, previously rare in the United States (1). The first U.S. case of monkeypox during the current outbreak was identified on May 17, 2022 (2). As of September 28, 2022, a total of 25,341 monkeypox cases have been reported in the United States.* The outbreak has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (3). JYNNEOS vaccine (Modified Vaccinia Ankara vaccine, Bavarian Nordic), administered subcutaneously as a 2-dose (0.5 mL per dose) series with doses administered 4 weeks apart, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019 to prevent smallpox and monkeypox infection (4). U.S. distribution of JYNNEOS vaccine as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for persons with known exposures to MPXV began in May 2022. A U.S. national vaccination strategy† for expanded PEP, announced on June 28, 2022, recommended subcutaneous vaccination of persons with known or presumed exposure to MPXV, broadening vaccination eligibility. FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) of intradermal administration of 0.1 mL of JYNNEOS on August 9, 2022, increased vaccine supply (5). As of September 28, 2022, most vaccine has been administered as PEP or expanded PEP. Because of the limited amount of time that has elapsed since administration of initial vaccine doses, as of September 28, 2022, relatively few persons in the current outbreak have completed the recommended 2-dose series.§ To examine the incidence of monkeypox among persons who were unvaccinated and those who had received ≥1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose, 5,402 reported monkeypox cases occurring among males¶ aged 18–49 years during July 31–September 3, 2022, were analyzed by vaccination status across 32 U.S. jurisdictions.** Average monkeypox incidence (cases per 100,000) among unvaccinated persons was 14.3 (95% CI = 5.0–41.0) times that among persons who received 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine ≥14 days earlier. Monitoring monkeypox incidence by vaccination status in timely surveillance data might provide early indications of vaccine-related protection that can be confirmed through other well-controlled vaccine effectiveness studies. This early finding suggests that a single dose of JYNNEOS vaccine provides some protection against monkeypox infection. The degree and durability of such protection is unknown, and it is recommended that people who are eligible for monkeypox vaccination receive the complete 2-dose series. 

Aggregate weekly numbers of confirmed and probable monkeypox cases†† among males aged 18–49 years with illness onset§§ during July 31–September 3, 2022, were analyzed across 32 public health jurisdictions. These jurisdictions routinely ascertain vaccination status¶¶ through patient interview or link cases with vaccination data from their immunization registries and separately submit deidentified vaccine administration data to CDC. The analysis was limited to males aged 18–49 years to exclude persons who might have received routine smallpox vaccination in childhood. Persons with monkeypox were categorized as 1) unvaccinated; 2) potentially vaccinated, without date of vaccination; 3) vaccinated, with illness onset ≤13 days after their first dose; or 4) vaccinated, with illness onset ≥14 days after their first dose.*** 

Vaccination coverage was estimated as the total number of persons vaccinated as of 2 weeks before the start date of a week, divided by the estimated population eligible for vaccination.††† This underlying population included persons in each jurisdiction who might benefit from expanded vaccination in the context of the outbreak and was estimated as the number of MSM with HIV or who are eligible for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (HIV-PrEP) (6). The number of eligible unvaccinated persons was obtained by subtracting the number of vaccinated persons from estimates of the vaccine-eligible population. Weekly§§§ incidence by vaccination status was calculated as the number of cases divided by the number of persons either unvaccinated as of that week or vaccinated as of 2 weeks earlier.¶¶¶ Because relatively few persons had received a second vaccine dose within the time frame of this analysis, incidence among persons who had received their first JYNNEOS vaccine dose ≥14 days earlier is reported. Persons with illness onset ≤13 days after receipt of their first dose of vaccine, potentially vaccinated persons (those without a documented date of vaccination), and persons vaccinated before 2022 were excluded from the analysis. The average incidence rate ratio (IRR) during the study period was calculated by dividing the weighted average incidence across all weeks among unvaccinated persons by that among vaccinated persons; a 95% CI for the average IRR was calculated to account for variation in weekly rates. Weighting was based on the population size in each vaccination status category. 

Two sensitivity analyses were conducted. The first examined changes in IRR when considering the total estimated MSM population as eligible for vaccination. The second examined changes in IRR under the assumptions that 50% or 100% of persons with monkeypox with unknown vaccination date received vaccine ≥14 days before illness onset. SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.0.3; R Foundation) were used to conduct all analyses. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**** 

During July 31–September 3, 2022, among 32 jurisdictions reporting 6,471 monkeypox cases (range across jurisdictions = 2–2,186 cases), a total of 5,402 (83.5%) were reported among males aged 18–49 years (Table). Among these, a total of 4,606 (85.3%) cases were among unvaccinated persons, 269 (5.0%) were among persons whose illness onset occurred ≤13 days after receipt of their first vaccine dose, 77 (1.4%) were among persons with illness onset ≥14 days after receipt of their first vaccine dose, and 450 (8.3%) were among persons without a known vaccination date. No persons vaccinated before 2022 were identified. Population coverage with 1 vaccine dose as of 2 weeks before the start of each week increased from 5.2% (July 31) to 29.9% (August 28) in the 32 jurisdictions; coverage with two vaccine doses increased from 0.1% to 1.9%. As of September 23, 2022, 10 and 2 cases had been reported in persons who had received a second JYNNEOS vaccine ≤13 days and ≥14 days before illness onset, respectively. 

Weekly monkeypox incidence during July 31–September 3 was higher among unvaccinated persons than among those who had received their first JYNNEOS vaccine dose ≥14 days earlier (Figure). Average IRR comparing unvaccinated persons with those who received 1 dose of vaccine ≥14 days earlier was 14.3 (95% CI = 5.0–41.0). A sensitivity analysis expanding the estimated number of persons eligible for vaccination yielded similar trends but lower average IRR (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121578). A sensitivity analysis examining changes to IRR assuming 50% or 100% of persons with unknown vaccination date received their vaccine dose ≥14 days before illness onset yielded similar trends but lower average IRR (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121579). 

","Among 32 U.S. jurisdictions, monkeypox incidence among persons who were currently recommended to receive PEP or expanded PEP with JYNNEOS vaccine was higher among unvaccinated persons compared with those who had received their first vaccine dose ≥14 days earlier. Data for this analysis were collected during a period when vaccine was widely available, reducing potential bias from limited vaccine accessibility. Findings are consistent with recent studies reporting that a single dose of JYNNEOS vaccine for prevention of MPXV infection in males aged 18–42 years who were prescribed HIV-PrEP or with diagnosed HIV infection and one or more other sexually transmitted infection might provide some protection (7) and modest induction of antibody levels after a single dose (8). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, linkage of monkeypox case surveillance and vaccination administration data might result in misclassifications that could influence IRR estimates. Some patients might not be linkable within a jurisdiction’s immunization registry because of receipt of vaccine outside the jurisdiction, or interviewed persons with monkeypox might have incorrectly reported their own vaccination status. This approach assumes that persons with unknown vaccination status were unvaccinated and excludes those with unknown date of vaccination because timing between vaccination and illness onset could not be established. Second, this analysis was unable to control for possible differences in testing or behaviors that increase risk for MPXV exposure or possible differences in risk because of patient characteristics (e.g., age and underlying medical conditions, including HIV status); consequently, causality and a full attribution of these results to vaccination cannot be inferred from these data. Third, incidence among persons who received 2 JYNNEOS vaccine doses could not be assessed, because of low second dose coverage and sparse data during the study period precluded these estimates. Fourth, temporality of exposures causing infection are not known. Vaccination strategies focused on PEP and expanded PEP during the study period; however, some patients might have received vaccine before exposure, or might have had additional exposures after vaccination. Fifth, confirmation that all identified persons with monkeypox were members of the population eligible for vaccination was not possible. Finally, data assessed from 32 jurisdictions accounted for 56% of the U.S. population eligible for vaccination and might not be generalizable. 

These data are intended to provide an early indication of the real-world impact of vaccination with JYNNEOS for preventing monkeypox and to guide public health prevention interventions (e.g., vaccinating persons at high risk for infection while still encouraging harm reduction strategies, including reducing the number of sexual partners and one-time sexual encounters) (9). The framework used in this analysis allows for ongoing comparison of observed IRRs over time and can be used to monitor vaccine performance after a second dose. Durability of immunity after a single dose is not yet known, and because vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection are anticipated to be better after 2 doses, it remains important that all vaccinated persons receive their second dose. Monitoring monkeypox incidence by vaccination status using currently available surveillance data might provide early estimates of vaccine performance for rapid public health decision making. Although the findings are encouraging, corroboration and confirmation through planned epidemiologic studies that are better able to account for potential biases are needed. This early finding suggests that a single dose of JYNNEOS vaccine provides some protection against monkeypox infection. It is recommended people who are eligible for monkeypox vaccination receive the complete 2-dose series.","Corresponding author: Amanda B.

Knowledge about monkeypox transmission risk in congregate settings is limited. 

What is added by this report? 

After a jail resident with symptomatic monkeypox spent 7 days in congregate housing, no cases were detected among a subset of residents with intermediate-risk exposures (being within 6 ft of the patient for ≥3 hours without wearing a mask) who received symptom monitoring or serologic testing. Monkeypox virus DNA, but no viable virus, was detected on one surface. Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) acceptance was highest when offered privately. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Although monkeypox transmission might be limited in similar congregate settings without higher-risk exposures, facilities should implement recommended infection control practices and provide prevention education including confidential PEP counseling.

Knowledge about monkeypox transmission risk in congregate settings is limited. In July 2022, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) confirmed a case of monkeypox in a person detained in Cook County Jail (CCJ) in Chicago, Illinois. This case was the first identified in a correctional setting in the United States and reported to CDC during the 2022 multinational monkeypox outbreak. CDPH collaborated with CCJ, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), and CDC to evaluate transmission risk within the facility. Fifty-seven residents were classified as having intermediate-risk exposures to the patient with monkeypox during the 7-day interval between the patient’s symptom onset and his isolation. (Intermediate-risk exposure was defined as potentially being within 6 ft of the patient with monkeypox for a total of ≥3 hours cumulatively, without wearing a surgical mask or respirator, or potentially having contact between their own intact skin or clothing and the skin lesions or body fluids from the patient or with materials that were in contact with the patient’s skin lesions or body fluids.) No secondary cases were identified among a subset of 62% of these potentially exposed residents who received symptom monitoring, serologic testing, or both. Thirteen residents accepted postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), with higher acceptance among those who were offered counseling individually or in small groups than among those who were offered PEP together in a large group. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) DNA, but no viable virus, was detected on one surface in a dormitory where the patient had been housed with other residents before he was isolated. Although monkeypox transmission might be limited in similar congregate settings in the absence of higher-risk exposures, congregate facilities should maintain recommended infection control practices in response to monkeypox cases, including placing the person with monkeypox in medical isolation and promptly and thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting spaces where the person has spent time. In addition, officials should provide information to residents and staff members about monkeypox symptoms and transmission modes, facilitate confidential monkeypox risk and symptom disclosure and prompt medical evaluation for symptoms that are reported, and provide PEP counseling in a private setting. 

Investigation and Results 
CCJ houses approximately 6,000 residents in cell-based and dormitory-based units across 16 buildings. The monkeypox case occurred in a resident who was booked into jail in mid-July 2022 (investigation day 1) and assigned to two congregate dormitories used for intake (dormitories A and B)† during the 7 days preceding his isolation for suspected monkeypox. On day 7, the resident placed a written request for health services, reporting swollen genitals, and CCJ health care personnel ordered a sexually transmitted infection laboratory panel. On day 8, health care administrators received a call from one of the patient’s family members alerting them to the possibility that the patient might have monkeypox; he was then evaluated in person and isolated. Lesion swab specimens collected for nonvariola Orthopoxvirus (NVO) testing on day 9 returned a positive result on day 11. During evaluation, the patient reported first noticing a localized rash on day 2, which subsequently spread over much of his body and was accompanied by fatigue and body aches before he was isolated. IDPH requested a CDC deployment team to assist with the investigation. This activity was reviewed and approved by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§ 

Fifty-seven other residents were housed with the patient for 1–7 nights (median = 5 nights) before he was isolated (Table) (Figure). Although CCJ policy required indoor mask use as a COVID-19 prevention strategy during the period of this investigation, enforcing mask use 24 hours per day in correctional facilities is challenging and mask usage is often low; the patient and other residents were not observed wearing masks consistently during this time. The patient reported during an interview that he had had no skin-to-skin or sexual contact with other residents, and no such contact between the patient and other residents was observed during review of security video footage. Because of the difficulty in ascertaining whether each resident sharing a dormitory with the patient met criteria for intermediate-risk exposure versus lower-risk exposure (simply entering the living space of a person with monkeypox), all 57 residents were conservatively categorized as having had intermediate-risk exposure.¶ 

On investigation day 15, serologic testing was offered to the 36 potentially exposed residents who were still in detention. One week later, on investigation day 22, serologic testing was again offered to those who had declined the first offer. Among all 36 residents still in detention, a total of 14 (39%) consented to testing. Specimens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-Orthopoxvirus immunoglobulin (Ig) M (a transient marker of acute infection or recent vaccination) and IgG (a long-lived marker generated during infection or vaccination) (1). None of the specimens tested positive for IgM. Specimens from three residents tested positive for IgG; all three were old enough to have received routine childhood smallpox vaccination, although their previous smallpox vaccination history could not be confirmed.** 

On investigation day 8, after the patient was isolated, CCJ resident-workers cleaned and disinfected dormitories A and B. To evaluate the extent of remaining surface contamination, 54 environmental samples were collected from both dormitories on investigation day 21, which was 18 days after the patient had been in dormitory A and 13 days after he had been in dormitory B.†† One dormitory B sample, collected from a vertical, painted concrete slab at the head of the patient’s bed, tested positive for NVO DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was confirmed by Clade II MPXV-specific PCR; viral culture was negative§§ (2). 

To identify possible exposure patterns in the dormitories and to assess residents’ knowledge about monkeypox, 16 potentially exposed residents were interviewed individually.¶¶ The majority of residents (12) reported washing their clothes in communal showers or sinks in the dormitory. Some residents reported sharing personal hygiene items (five) or eating utensils (four) with other residents, engaging in physical altercations (four), sitting on other residents’ beds (three), or sharing or touching other residents’ linens (two). None reported sexual contact with others while in CCJ. The majority (13) also reported hearing about monkeypox for the first time while detained in CCJ. Residents’ knowledge about monkeypox symptoms, transmission modes, and exposure risks varied but was generally low. 


Public Health Response 
CDPH recommended PEP and daily symptom monitoring for 21 days after last exposure for all 57 potentially exposed residents.*** CCJ notified the residents of their potential exposure and, out of an abundance of caution, placed them under quarantine precautions within dormitories A and B. One resident reported a rash on investigation day 22 and was evaluated the same day; test results for NVO were negative. Among the 57 residents, 35 (61%) remained in detention for their full 21-day monitoring period (33 in CCJ and two transferred to a state prison). The remaining 22 (39%) residents were discharged to the community before conclusion of their 21-day monitoring period and were lost to follow-up. However, CDPH cross-checked the names of the discharged residents with the Illinois state testing database and confirmed that none had a record of monkeypox testing in the 30 days after their last potential exposure in CCJ.††† 

On investigation day 15, PEP with JYNNEOS vaccine was offered to the 36 (63%) potentially exposed residents who were still in detention at that time (the same 36 residents who were also offered serologic testing on day 15 as part of the investigation). Dormitory B residents received PEP information as a large group, followed by a public roll call offering PEP to each resident. Staff members reported difficulty communicating effectively in the large group; only three of 25 (12%) residents who were offered PEP in this setting accepted. In subsequent individual interviews, several dormitory B residents indicated they did not want to receive the vaccine in front of others, did not know enough about the vaccine or potential side effects, or thought they were being offered a COVID-19 vaccine. In contrast, dormitory A residents were escorted to a separate room individually or in groups of two, where they were counseled and offered PEP; six of 11 offered PEP in this setting accepted. On day 22, PEP was reoffered individually to eight residents from dormitories A and B participating in individual interviews who had declined the first PEP offer; four accepted. Overall, 13 (23%) of 57 residents received PEP 7–14 days after their last potential exposure (median = 12 days). 

In early August, CCJ added monkeypox screening questions (presence of rash or known close contact with someone with monkeypox) to the intake process for new residents entering CCJ. Shortly thereafter, a newly detained resident answered “no” to all screening questions but later, in a private exam room with a medical provider, disclosed that he had been hospitalized with monkeypox 2 weeks before his arrest.","After a CCJ resident with symptomatic monkeypox spent 7 days in congregate housing, no additional cases were detected among a subset of residents classified as having intermediate-risk exposures (62%) who were monitored for symptoms or who received serologic testing. Although the patient reported no skin-to-skin or sexual contact with other residents, all residents slept in the same room with the patient and shared living and dining spaces and bathroom facilities. These findings suggest that monkeypox transmission might be limited in similar congregate settings in the absence of higher-risk exposures such as skin-to-skin or sexual contact (the primary transmission modes identified during the current multinational outbreak). Current CDC guidance does not recommend quarantine for exposed persons who remain asymptomatic; these findings affirm application of this guidance within congregate settings.§§§ 

Although this investigation found no evidence of skin-to-skin or sexual contact among residents in CCJ, previous research emphasizes that persons who are incarcerated might not disclose intimate or sexual contact within the facility because of potential stigma, retaliation, or disciplinary consequences (3). Furthermore, monkeypox transmission has been documented in correctional settings previously, including a cluster of five cases and an outbreak of 21 cases in Nigerian prisons in 2017 and 2022, respectively, where the transmission modes could not be definitively ascertained (4,5). In this investigation, some residents disclosed contact patterns in the dormitory overall (not necessarily with the patient with monkeypox) that have previously been associated with transmission in household studies (e.g., sharing eating utensils and linens) (6). Thus, correctional facilities need to remain vigilant for potential cases of monkeypox while transmission continues to occur in the United States. 

Results of PCR testing of surfaces in the shared CCJ dormitories indicate that at least one surface retained MPXV DNA at the time of sampling: a vertical, painted concrete slab at the head of the patient’s bed. Residents commonly lean against this type of surface while sitting in bed, or drape damp clothing and towels over it to dry. Although no viable virus was detected on the surface at the time of sampling, studies with vaccinia virus have found viable virus persisting up to 28 days on a similar surface, indicating the importance of thoroughly disinfecting all areas where a person with monkeypox has spent time, including all surfaces they might have touched or that might have had contact with their clothing or linens (7). Facilities should ensure that residents and staff members responsible for cleaning and disinfection receive adequate training, supplies, and oversight to complete these tasks. 

Approximately one third of CCJ residents who were exposed to the patient with monkeypox were discharged before PEP was offered, and those who accepted PEP received it 7–14 days after exposure, outside the 4-day window recommended to prevent infection. Among residents offered PEP, approximately one third accepted it, a rate lower than that reported among community and health care contacts during previous monkeypox outbreaks (8). Notably, PEP acceptance was higher among residents who received individual or small group counseling (55%) than among those who were offered PEP while in a large group (12%). Similarly, a resident booked into CCJ after the conclusion of this investigation privately disclosed a recent hospitalization for monkeypox after previously answering “no” to all screening questions asked in a semipublic intake space. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, exposure risk assessment was challenging in the congregate housing setting, and some residents classified as having intermediate-risk exposure actually could have had a lower-risk exposure. Second, serologic testing and symptom monitoring were completed for only 25% and 62% of exposed residents, respectively. Third, serologic testing was performed 7 days after potential exposure for some residents, when they might not yet have seroconverted, possibly resulting in misclassification of secondary cases. Fourth, monkeypox-related stigma or desire to avoid isolation could have limited self-report of symptoms or higher-risk contact such as sexual activity. Finally, findings might not be generalizable to all congregate settings because of variation in facility layout, ventilation, housing density, laundry practices, and adherence to infection prevention and control protocols, and because of differences in viral shedding and infectious period among persons with monkeypox. Additional data can further elucidate transmission risk in congregate settings overall. 

Correctional facilities can reduce monkeypox transmission risk by following public health recommendations (Box). First, facilities should maintain infection control protocols in response to cases, including isolation of persons with suspected monkeypox and prompt and thorough cleaning and disinfection of all areas where the person has spent time¶¶¶ (9). Second, facilities should provide monkeypox prevention information to residents and staff members, including information about avoiding sexual contact in the custody setting and avoiding common practices such as sharing eating utensils and linens. Third, facility officials should follow health department guidance for postexposure symptom monitoring and PEP, provide information about monkeypox signs and symptoms and how to report them confidentially, and ensure prompt evaluation when residents do report symptoms. Using private spaces during intake screening, exposure notification, and PEP counseling can support disclosure of sensitive information and could improve acceptance of public health recommendations.","Corresponding author: Liesl M.

Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, can harm the developing adolescent brain, and can increase risk for future addiction to other drugs (2). Among middle and high school current e-cigarette users (i.e., use on ≥1 day during the past 30 days), use of disposable e-cigarette devices* increased significantly between 2019 and 2020 (3) and was the most commonly used device type reported in 2021 (4). In 2020 and 2021, approximately eight in 10 middle and high school students who used e-cigarettes reported using flavored e-cigarettes (4,5). CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed nationally representative data from the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), a school-based, cross-sectional, self-administered survey conducted during January 18–May 31, 2022,† using a web-based survey instrument and administered to U.S. middle school (grades 6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students.§ Participating students could complete the survey whether they were physically in school or at home engaging in remote learning; 99.3% of students reported completing the survey in school. Current e-cigarette use was assessed overall and by frequency of use, device type, flavors, and brands used (any brand used and usual brand used).¶ Weighted prevalence estimates and population totals were calculated.** The NYTS study protocol was reviewed and approved by CDC’s institutional review board.†† 

In 2022, 14.1% of high school students and 3.3% of middle school students reported current e-cigarette use (Table). Among current e-cigarette users, 42.3% reported using e-cigarettes frequently,§§ including 46.0% of high school students and 20.8% of middle school students; daily use was reported among 27.6% of current e-cigarette users, including 30.1% of high school students and 11.7% of middle school students. Among current e-cigarette users, the types of devices most often used were disposables (high school = 57.2%; middle school = 45.8%), followed by prefilled or refillable pods or cartridges (high school = 25.7%; middle school = 21.6%), and tanks or mod systems (high school = 5.9%; middle school = 9.8%), with 11.2% of high school students and nearly 23% of middle school students reporting not knowing the type of e-cigarette device used. 

Among current e-cigarette users, Puff Bar was the most commonly reported brand used in the past 30 days by both middle and high school students (29.7%), followed by Vuse (23.6%), JUUL (22.0%), SMOK (13.5%), NJOY (8.3%), Hyde (7.3%), and blu (6.5%). Among current e-cigarette users, 14.5% reported that the brand they usually used was Puff Bar, followed by Vuse (12.5%), Hyde (5.5%), and SMOK (4.0%). Approximately one fifth (21.8%) of current e-cigarette users reported “some other brand” as their usual brand. 

Among current e-cigarette users overall, 84.9% used flavored e-cigarettes; of these, the reported flavor types, in descending order of use, were fruit (69.1%); candy, desserts, or other sweets (38.3%); mint (29.4%); and menthol (26.6%). A similar pattern was observed among current users of flavored disposable e-cigarettes: fruit (75.2%); candy, desserts, or other sweets (40.4%); mint (29.6%); and menthol (16.7%) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121630). Among current users of flavored pods or cartridges, the reported flavor types used were fruit (58.4%); menthol (53.9%); candy, desserts, or other sweets (30.3%); and mint (27.6%). Among current users of flavored tanks or mod systems, the reported flavor types used were fruit (69.6%); candy, desserts, or other sweets (47.7%); mint (40.1%); and menthol (35.2%). 

In 2022, 2.55 million U.S. middle and high school students currently used e-cigarettes. Most reported using flavored products, and, among those students, approximately seven of 10 used fruit flavors. Disposable products were the most commonly reported device type. Further, among middle and high school students who used e-cigarettes, approximately four in 10 reported frequent use, and approximately one in four reported daily use. The use of tobacco products in any form, including e-cigarettes, by middle and high school students is unsafe. Sustained implementation of comprehensive tobacco prevention and control strategies at the national, state, and local levels,¶¶ coupled with FDA regulation and enforcement, is critical to addressing e-cigarette use among middle and high school students (2).

This increase affected all ages and most population groups, but not equally: existing disparities, including racial and ethnic disparities, widened. The firearm suicide rate was higher than the firearm homicide rate in 2020 and remained consistent with recent years overall; however, increases were observed in some groups (1). To assess potential increases from 2020 to 2021, final 2020 and provisional 2021, National Vital Statistics System mortality data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates were used to examine all-cause homicide and suicide rates; firearm homicide and suicide rates overall and by sex, age,* race and ethnicity; and the percentage of homicides and suicides from firearm injuries.† This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§ 

An estimated 20,966 firearm homicides and 26,320 firearm suicides occurred in the United States during 2021 (Table). From 2020 to 2021, the percentage of homicides and suicides attributed to firearm injuries increased from 79% to 81% and from 53% to 55%, respectively, resulting in the highest percentage for homicide in more than 50 years and the highest percentage for suicide since 2001. 

The firearm homicide rate in 2021 was 8.3% higher than it was in 2020 (Table); increases occurred among both males and females. The highest rates were generally among persons aged 25–44 years, with increases occurring in each racial and ethnic population in that age group (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121555). Non-Hispanic Black or African American persons continued to experience the highest firearm homicide rates in every age group. 

The firearm suicide rate among persons aged ≥10 years also increased 8.3% from 2020 to 2021 (Table), with increases among males and females, and most age by race and ethnicity groups (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121555). The highest firearm suicide rates for persons aged <45 years were among non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons, and the highest rates for those aged ≥45 years were among non-Hispanic White persons. 

The overall U.S. firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates in 2021 were the highest documented since 1993 and 1990, respectively. Some racial and ethnic groups experienced substantially higher rates in 2021, and among some groups, disparities continued to widen. This analysis cannot explain the reasons for the increases; however, multiple social and structural conditions are associated with risk for homicide and suicide. Systemic inequities (e.g., in economic, educational, housing, and employment opportunities) and structural racism have contributed to disparities in outcomes, and the COVID-19 pandemic could have worsened these conditions, especially in some racial and ethnic communities (1,2). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the 2021 data in this report are provisional and might change when final data are available; however, reported rates are unlikely to shift downward. Second, rates for some population groups could not be reported because of small counts. Finally, some racial and ethnic groups, particularly AI/AN persons, might be undercounted because of misclassification (3). 

Increases since 2020 and record high rates of firearm homicide and suicide in 2021 underscore the urgent need for prevention efforts. Public health can facilitate collaboration across sectors, including health, law enforcement, education, social services, and community organizations, to implement a coordinated and comprehensive approach based on the best available evidence. To help communities make use of the best available evidence for violence prevention, CDC has released Technical Packages for Violence Prevention.¶ Prevention efforts can include street outreach and hospital-based interventions, efforts to enhance secure firearm storage and reduce access to firearms among those at risk for harming themselves or others, changes to the physical environment (e.g., remediating vacant lots to enhance safe spaces), programs that enhance positive social connections or teach coping and problem-solving skills, therapeutic interventions (e.g., crisis intervention and treatment to address previous trauma), and policies (e.g., housing and economic) that address underlying risks and inequities.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Thomas R.

An epidemiologic investigation was conducted to establish exposure links and provide guidance to hospitals and health care providers. On December 7, 2021, epidemiology program managers at county health departments in the region including Pasco County, Pinellas County, and Polk County, and emergency department physicians as well as medical examiners at Advent Health, St. Joseph Hospital, and Tampa General Hospital were informed about these three patients and asked to report any suspected cases. A press release was issued to the public for awareness. Florida’s syndromic surveillance database, Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics, was used to monitor Florida Poison Information Center, emergency department, and urgent care data for potential new cases. Case definitions were established based on the nationwide 2018 incident (1). Patients were interviewed, and medical records were reviewed to collect information on patient demographics; signs and symptoms; SCB, marijuana, or other drug use; product purchase locations; and exposure to prescription vitamin K oxidoreductase antagonists. 

A total of 52 cases were identified; 43 (82.7%) were confirmed and nine (17.3%) probable. A total of 38 (73.1%) cases were distributed throughout north and east Tampa; the other cases occurred sporadically throughout Hillsborough County. One patient was identified in neighboring Pinellas County. All patients except one were admitted to hospitals in Hillsborough County. The mean patient age was 36 years (range = 16–63 years); 40 (76.9%) were male. A total of 47 (87.0%) reported using SCBs with similar purchase locations before symptom onset. Five patients had both elevated international normalized ratios (INRs) and positive brodifacoum tests but did not report SCB use.* Symptom onset occurred during November 24–December 19, 2021 (Figure). The most common symptoms were hematuria (36; 69.2%), abdominal pain (33; 63.5%), and hematemesis (16; 30.8%). INR measurements were elevated in all patients; the median INR was 12.8 (range = 3.9 to >15) (2). Four (7.7%) patients died; the mean age of deceased patients was 34 years. 

None of the patients reported taking prescribed vitamin K oxidoreductase antagonists that could cause a substantial change in INR measurements. Five patients provided the SCB products they had smoked start highlightfor analysis by the DEA TOX Toxicology Testing Programend highlight, of which four tested positive for brodifacoum, a long-acting vitamin K oxidoreductase antagonist.† All five products tested positive for the SCBs 4F-MDMB-BUTICA and ADB-BUTINACA. 

Vitamin K1 was used to treat vitamin K oxidoreductase antagonist coagulopathy; treatment was administered by both oral and intravenous routes. Patients began with intravenous vitamin K1 and transitioned to oral vitamin K1. Many patients needed high doses of oral vitamin K1 (i.e., 150 mg/day), which required taking 30 5-mg tablets daily during hospitalization and for 3–6 months after discharge, with treatment time varying for each patient based on their brodifacoum terminal elimination (3). Approximately two thirds of patients (34; 65.4%) were uninsured and unable to pay for inpatient and outpatient treatment; oral vitamin K1 treatment can cost ≥$65,000 per month. With assistance from Hillsborough County, 12 patients were enrolled in a local managed health care program for residents with limited income. A private pharmaceutical company donated enough vitamin K1 tablets to treat all 52 patients. 

Three major challenges were identified during this incident response. First, diagnosis of a specific vitamin K oxidoreductase antagonist (i.e., brodifacoum) was challenging because diagnosis required testing against an anticoagulant panel that is expensive (i.e., >$750 per specimen), has long turnaround time, and is only offered by a single private laboratory. Initially, this laboratory performed only qualitative analysis while the testing to be able to perform quantitative brodifacoum testing was calibrated. Once the qualitative result was positive, the laboratory performed quantitative brodifacoum testing to aid in patient monitoring throughout the event. Through discussion with Florida Poison Information Center Tampa, the private laboratory was able to reduce the cost of quantitative brodifacoum testing and decrease turnaround time for patients involved in this event. Serial quantitative brodifacoum testing was eventually performed to help determine when therapy could be discontinued (3). Second, treatment required high doses of vitamin K1 during an extended period of time, and local pharmacies only had a limited supply.§ Before the private pharmaceutical company donated the vitamin K1 tablets, a contingency plan was developed to obtain them from other hospitals in the region in the event pharmacies were to run out of supply. Third, maintaining patient compliance and adherence to this treatment plan is challenging because of the high cost and cumbersome treatment regimen (4). These challenges reflect similar issues that arose during the 2018 incident; all stakeholders should discuss these issues and identify solutions for optimal patient care. 

Communicating timely information to health care providers and the general public allowed for additional patient identification and was crucial to connecting with patients who needed medical care.

Hepatitis A cases declined substantially in the United States after the introduction of hepatitis A vaccines in 1996. 

What is added by this report? 

Hepatitis A epidemiology in the United States has shifted as a result of recent and ongoing outbreaks associated with person-to-person transmission. During August 1, 2016–December 31, 2020, 33 states reported hepatitis A outbreaks involving approximately 37,500 cases. Among cases with available information, 56% of persons reported drug use, 14% reported homelessness, and 61% were hospitalized; 380 outbreak-associated deaths were reported. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Increased hepatitis A vaccination coverage, through implementation of nontraditional vaccination strategies to reach disproportionately affected populations, along with improved universal and catch-up childhood vaccination, will be necessary to respond to the current hepatitis A outbreaks and prevent similar outbreaks in the future.

Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease typically acquired through fecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection rates in the United States declined approximately 97% during 1995–2015 after the introduction and widespread pediatric use of hepatitis A vaccines (1). Since 2016, hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported in 37 states, involving approximately 44,650 cases, 27,250 hospitalizations, and 415 deaths as of September 23, 2022 (2). A report describing early outbreaks in four states during 2017 noted that most infections occurred among persons reporting injection or noninjection drug use or experiencing homelessness; this finding signaled a shift in HAV infection epidemiology from point-source outbreaks associated with contaminated food to large community outbreaks associated with person-to-person transmission (3). CDC analyzed interim data from 33 outbreak-affected states to characterize demographic, risk factor, and clinical outcome data from 37,553 outbreak-associated hepatitis A cases reported during August 1, 2016–December 31, 2020. Among persons with available risk factor or clinical outcome information, 56% reported drug use, 14% reported experiencing homelessness, and 61% had been hospitalized; 380 outbreak-associated deaths were reported. The most effective means to prevent and control hepatitis A outbreaks is through hepatitis A vaccination, particularly for persons at increased risk for HAV infection (4). The epidemiologic shifts identified during these outbreaks led to a 2019 recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for vaccination of persons experiencing homelessness and reinforcement of existing vaccination recommendations for persons who use drugs (4). Substantial progress in the prevention and control of hepatitis A has been made; the number of outbreak-affected states has been reduced from 37 to 13 (2). Increased hepatitis A vaccination coverage, particularly through implementation of successful, nontraditional vaccination strategies among disproportionately affected populations (5), is needed to continue progress in halting current outbreaks and preventing similar outbreaks in the future. 

Health departments investigated HAV infections among persons who met the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists’ hepatitis A case definition† using state-specific case investigation forms. Deidentified demographic, risk factor, and clinical outcome data were requested from all states reporting outbreaks for all outbreak-associated cases during August 1, 2016–December 31, 2020. Risk factors were assessed during the exposure period (15–50 days before symptom onset). States were excluded from variable-specific analysis of any variable with 100% missing data. The analysis was conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Data collection, which was directly related to disease control, was deemed not to be human subjects research. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§ 

CDC analyzed data from 33 of 36 (92%) outbreak-affected states¶ that were eligible for inclusion** (Figure); these 33 states accounted for approximately 97% of publicly reported hepatitis A outbreak-associated cases at the end of 2020 (4). Among 37,553 reported cases, most were among males (62%), White persons (81%), and those aged 30–49 years (58%) (Table). Median age was 38 years. Among cases with data available, 5% and 30% had evidence of past or current hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection, respectively; 61% of persons with hepatitis A were hospitalized, and 1% died. Among persons with outbreak-associated HAV infection and available risk factor information, 56% reported injection or noninjection drug use, 14% reported experiencing homelessness, 12% reported recent incarceration, and 3% reported recent international travel; 5% of males self-identified as men who have sex with men. 

","Since 2016, the United States has experienced widespread hepatitis A outbreaks associated with person-to-person transmission. Interim data from 33 states were analyzed to characterize demographic, risk factor, and clinical outcome data from 37,553 outbreak-associated cases reported during August 1, 2016–December 31, 2020. Cases occurred predominantly among males, White persons, and those aged 30–49 years. The most frequently reported risk factor was drug use. 

These outbreaks mark a shift in hepatitis A epidemiology in the United States. Before the introduction of hepatitis A vaccines, HAV transmission was driven largely by spread from asymptomatically infected children, and hepatitis A disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority populations (6). In these recent hepatitis A outbreaks associated with person-to-person transmission, however, fewer than 1% of cases occurred among persons aged <18 years, and among cases with available race data, more than 80% occurred among White persons. Whereas international travel and exposure to foodborne outbreaks were previously the most frequently reported risk factors (7), drug use (both injection and noninjection) was the predominant risk factor associated with HAV transmission during the 2016–2020 outbreaks. HAV transmission among persons who use drugs occurs through the fecal-oral route (e.g., resulting from lack of sanitation or poor hygiene practices) and might occur percutaneously during injection drug use (3). 

Sixty-one percent of persons were hospitalized during the hepatitis A outbreaks associated with person-to-person transmission, which substantially exceeds the proportion of hospitalized cases historically reported in the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS); in 2016, 42% of persons with hepatitis A cases reported to NNDSS were hospitalized (8). The older age of patients and corresponding increased likelihood of comorbidities (including coinfection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus in nearly one third of cases) likely contributed to the higher prevalence of hospitalization observed in the recent and ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks. Hospitalization and death from HAV infection occur more frequently among adults than among children (9). 

The outbreaks described in this report are unprecedented in the hepatitis A vaccine era. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data obtained during 2011–2016 indicated that more than 60% of U.S.–born, noninstitutionalized civilian adults in risk groups recommended to receive hepatitis A vaccine by ACIP since 1996 remained susceptible to HAV infection (10). Proactive vaccination of adults at increased risk for HAV infection or adverse consequences of infection is critical to prevent outbreaks and serious illness. 

In collaboration with state and local health departments, CDC launched a large-scale, multidisciplinary response in 2017 to control the ongoing outbreaks associated with person-to-person transmission. To provide hepatitis A vaccination to disproportionately affected populations most affected by the outbreaks, health departments developed and implemented nontraditional vaccination and staffing strategies (5). These included holding satellite vaccination clinics (e.g., at correctional facilities, substance use treatment facilities, syringe services programs, and homeless shelters) and broadening the scope of health care professionals approved to administer vaccines. To overcome barriers to vaccination, including mistrust, stigma, and vaccine hesitancy, health departments partnered with organizations that have long-standing, trusted relationships with persons at risk for HAV infection (5). In September 2022, as a result of these intensive and innovative efforts, 24 states have officially declared their outbreaks over, and the remaining 13 states report decreased case counts from the peaks of their outbreaks (2). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, risk factor data were self-reported and subject to recall and social desirability biases. Second, hepatitis A surveillance in the United States is passive; thus, case counts might underestimate the actual number of cases. Third, a substantial proportion of data was missing; caution should be exercised when interpreting results with high rates of missing data. Fourth, ethnicity was not systematically ascertained and could not be included. Finally, states did not use an identical hepatitis A–related death case classification, which might have resulted in differential classification of deaths as being hepatitis A–related. 

Hepatitis A epidemiology in the United States has shifted as a result of the ongoing outbreaks associated with person-to-person transmission. Cases occurred almost exclusively among adults, and HAV transmission was driven primarily by close contact among persons who use illicit drugs and persons experiencing homelessness. Improving services for these populations, including access to substance use treatment and sanitation, are important considerations in mitigating HAV transmission. Many adults at increased risk for HAV infection remain vulnerable to infection, despite long-standing vaccination recommendations. Given the high hospitalization rate during these outbreaks and the high level of susceptibility to HAV infection among adults in the United States, efforts are needed to improve awareness of and adherence to ACIP hepatitis A vaccination recommendations. Increased hepatitis A vaccination coverage, through implementation of nontraditional vaccination strategies to reach disproportionately affected populations, along with improved universal and catch-up childhood vaccination, will be necessary to respond to the current hepatitis A outbreaks and prevent similar outbreaks in the future. Lessons learned during these outbreaks have been reinforced by experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and other vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. Disproportionately affected populations often experience stigma, mistrust, and societal barriers that limit adequate access to the health care system. Continued improvements in vaccination infrastructure, immunization information systems, and education and outreach are critically needed to build vaccine confidence and improve vaccine delivery in nontraditional settings.","Corresponding author: Megan G.

Limited data suggest that para-fluorofentanyl is likely similar to or slightly less potent than IMF (3,4); however, its role in the illicit drug market and its impact on the opioid overdose crisis has not been widely studied. To better understand monthly trends in drug overdose deaths involving para-fluorofentanyl in the United States, CDC analyzed overdose death data from the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS). 

SUDORS includes data from death certificates and medical examiner and coroner reports (including enhanced postmortem toxicology testing) on unintentional and undetermined-intent drug overdose deaths. CDC assessed monthly frequencies of overdose deaths during July 2020–June 2021 involving (i.e., listed as a cause of death) para-fluorofentanyl, among 42 states§ and the District of Columbia. Para-fluorofentanyl–involved deaths were stratified by jurisdiction and U.S. Census Bureau region.¶ This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.** 

Para-fluorofentanyl was involved in 1,658 (2.6%) of 64,915 overdose deaths reported by 43 jurisdictions during July 2020–June 2021. Para-fluorofentanyl–involved deaths increased from the first reported occurrences in September 2020 (five deaths) through a peak of 293 deaths in May 2021 (Figure). The number of para-fluorofentanyl–involved deaths increased 455.3% from 253 during July–December 2020 to 1,405 during January–June 2021. Deaths involving para-fluorofentanyl occurred in 35 jurisdictions and accounted for 3.9%, 2.9%, 1.9%, and 1.1% of overdose deaths in included jurisdictions in the Northeast, South, Midwest, and West U.S. Census Bureau regions, respectively. Six states (Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee) reported more than 100 deaths involving para-fluorofentanyl. Para-fluorofentanyl–involved deaths nearly always co-involved IMF††; co-involvement ranged from 100% of deaths in September 2020 to 90.8% in June 2021. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, analyses were limited to 43 jurisdictions and might not be generalizable to the entire United States. Second, although comprehensive postmortem testing protocols recommend IMF testing (5), lack of standard testing requirements might lead to an underestimation of para-fluorofentanyl involvement in drug overdose deaths. The rise in para-flourofentanyl detection could also be caused by increases in testing during the study period. Finally, death certification training and experience vary across and within medical examiner and coroner systems, potentially leading to differences in para-fluorofentanyl’s inclusion as the cause of death even when it is detected. 

The emergence of para-fluorofentanyl involvement in deaths in 35 SUDORS-funded jurisdictions supports and furthers evidence of recent increases (1–3). Because of high co-involvement with IMF, it is unclear whether the proliferation of para-fluorofentanyl reflects a diversification of the illicit drug market (i.e., para-fluorofentanyl is being mixed with IMF) or it has emerged as a new stand-alone product. Because data on potency are limited, it is unclear whether para-fluorofentanyl poses a higher risk than does fentanyl alone; however, access to and timely administration of naloxone to reverse opioid overdoses (1), as well as ensuring access to substance use prevention and treatment services, including distribution of fentanyl test strips, is crucial to prevent para-fluorofentanyl overdose deaths. In addition, because the illicit drug market continues to evolve rapidly and some jurisdictions might have a lack of or limited testing capabilities, a critical need exists for expanded, enhanced toxicology testing to detect para-fluorofentanyl and other emerging drugs.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Christine L.

COVID-19 vaccines have been effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated hospitalizations and deaths among nursing home residents. 

What is added by this report? 

In a large cohort of nursing home residents, receipt of a second mRNA COVID-19 booster dose during circulation of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants was 74% effective at 60 days against severe COVID-19–related outcomes (including hospitalization or death) and 90% against death alone compared with receipt of a single booster dose. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Efforts should be made to ensure that nursing home residents remain up to date with recommended booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines.

Nursing home residents continue to experience significant COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (1). On March 29, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for adults aged ≥50 years and all immunocompromised persons who had received a first booster ≥4 months earlier.* On September 1, 2022, ACIP voted to recommend bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine boosters for all persons aged ≥12 years who had completed the primary series using monovalent vaccines ≥2 months earlier (2). Data on COVID-19 booster dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the nursing home population are limited (3). For this analysis, academic, federal, and private partners evaluated routine care data collected from 196 U.S. community nursing homes to estimate VE of a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose among nursing home residents who had received 3 previous COVID-19 vaccine doses (2 primary series doses and 1 booster dose). Residents who received second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses during March 29–June 15, 2022, with follow-up through July 25, 2022, were found to have 60-day VE of 25.8% against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 infection), 73.9% against severe COVID-19 outcomes (a combined endpoint of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations or deaths), and 89.6% against COVID-19–associated deaths alone. During this period, subvariants BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 (March–June 2022), and BA.4 and BA.5 (July 2022) of the B.1.1.529 and BA.2 (Omicron) variant were predominant. These findings suggest that among nursing home residents, second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster doses provided additional protection over first booster doses against severe COVID-19 outcomes during a time of emerging Omicron variants. Facilities should continue to ensure that nursing home residents remain up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including bivalent vaccine booster doses, to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes. 

This analysis emulated target trials that compared the effectiveness of a second mRNA booster dose versus non-receipt among recipients of 2 primary doses followed by 1 booster dose. A series of sequential index dates (i.e., trials) were included to assess VE among nursing home residents during March 29–June 15, 2022, with a maximum of 60-days of follow-up through July 25, 2022. The population included nursing home residents from 196 nursing homes in 19 states† operated by Genesis HealthCare.§ Nursing home residents were eligible for study inclusion if they 1) had been present in the nursing home for ≥100 days with <10 days spent out of the facility, 2) had received 3 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine before the index date, and 3) had not received a COVID-19 vaccination in ≥120 days. Nursing home residents were excluded if they had a SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 30 days preceding the index date, had received monoclonal antibodies during the 90 days preceding the index date, or were receiving hospice care. 

Nursing home residents who had been vaccinated on each specific index date were assigned to the treatment group, and those who were unvaccinated but eligible were assigned as controls. Vaccination status was determined using residents’ immunization record from nursing home electronic health record systems. Nursing home residents who had received 3 previous mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses, irrespective of timing of vaccination were considered to have received the primary series and first booster vaccination. This analysis employed similar analytic methods to other target trial emulations with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (4,5). Those who had received the second booster dose were matched to controls exactly by facility of residence and index date with 1:1 nearest neighbor matching with a maximum of 0.2 standardized mean difference in propensity score between pairs. If the matched control subsequently received a second booster dose, follow-up ceased for both the control and matched resident in the treatment group at that time. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression adjusting for 1) previous COVID-19 infection history (based on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code U07.1 or SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test result), 2) immunosuppressive condition, 3) “do not resuscitate” orders, 4) acute hospitalization during the preceding 90 days, 5) time since last COVID-19 vaccination, 6) length of stay in the nursing home, 7) history of any influenza vaccination during the previous influenza season, 8) age, and 9) number of Charlson index comorbidities (6). 

COVID-19 testing followed CDC guidelines for nursing homes, and included testing on admission, readmission, recent exposure, or occurrence of a new symptom. Direct care staff members were tested weekly, and residents could be tested based on recent staff member exposure (7). The four outcomes assessed were 1) any incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a new positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test result, 2) hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2–related illness (transfer to an acute care hospital within 21 days of a new positive SARS-CoV-2 test result), 3) death occurring within 30 days of a new positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 4) severe COVID-19 outcomes (combined endpoint of hospitalization or death). Kaplan-Meier estimators were used to estimate VE as 1 − relative ratio of the cumulative incidence curves between groups at each time point. Observations with missing values were excluded from analysis. Sampling with replacement by matched pair with 500 replications was used to generate 95% CIs. Data were collected from nursing home electronic health record systems. Initial data preparation was conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and STATA (version 16; Statacorp). All analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 4.0.1; R Foundation). This activity was deemed not to be human subject research by the Brown University institutional review board and was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶ 

The analysis included 9,527 unique residents across 196 nursing homes (median of 49 residents per facility [IQR = 35–61]). Among these residents, 9,503 (99.7%) served as controls for ≥1 day of follow-up and 3,245 (34.1%) residents received a second booster dose during the study period and were eligible to be included in the treatment group. In the matched analysis, 1,902 residents were matched 1:1 with controls; 1,343 residents were excluded because they could not be matched to a control. Residents in the matched group had a mean age of 78 years, a median length of stay of 880 days, a median 196 days since the last COVID-19 vaccination, four Charlson comorbidities, and 35.5% were male. Observed characteristics between matched groups were <0.1 standard mean differences (Table 1). Compared with matched residents, the 1,343 excluded residents were similar, with a mean age of 78 years, a median length of stay of 931 days, a median 202 days since the last COVID-19 vaccination, four Charlson comorbidities, and 35% were male. 

Compared with a first booster dose only, 60-day VE of a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose was 25.8% (95% CI = 1.2–44.3) against infection, 60.1% (95% CI = −18.8−91.5) against hospitalization, 89.6% (95% CI = 45.0–100.0) against death, and 73.9% (95% CI = 36.1–92.2) against the severe composite outcome of COVID-19–associated hospitalization or death (Table 2).","In this analysis, comparing the relative effectiveness of a second booster dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines with a single booster dose among eligible nursing home residents in 19 states, VE of a second booster dose against the severe composite outcomes of SARS-CoV-2–associated hospitalization or death was 73.9% and 89.6% for death alone. VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period crossing both Omicron subvariants BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 (March–June 2022) and BA.4 and BA.5 (July 2022) predominance was 25.8%. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the point estimates for the findings in the current study are similar to those estimated in previous studies; however, too few hospitalization events were observed to definitely attribute a reduction to vaccination. A recent study from Israel provided similar VE estimates during B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant circulation for a second booster dose (34% against infection, 64% for hospitalization, and 72% against death) in a long-term care setting (8). Similarly, a Canadian study reported a 40% relative VE of 4 (versus 3) doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine against hospital admission or death among nursing home residents (9) and a U.S study reported 80% VE for a second booster dose (compared with no vaccine) against hospitalization among immunocompetent adults aged ≥50 years during Omicron BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 subvariant predominance (10). However, comparisons with other published studies are challenging because of differences in methods, population health, and virus characteristics, as well as other factors (e.g., time since the last vaccine dose when VE is measured). Unique features of the present analysis compared with previous studies are the focus on the incremental benefit of the second booster dose compared with 1 booster dose (i.e., 4 versus 3 doses) during a period when Omicron BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 and later BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants were the dominant circulating variants; and use of an emulated target trial design, which applied robust matching to compare persons with similar characteristics at time of vaccination. Second, the composite endpoint of death or hospitalization was included because, in the nursing home population, hospitalizing a resident is subject to many considerations beyond acute illness. The overall health and functional status, life expectancy, resident and family wishes, and general policies of that site are considered. Some residents might have a low likelihood of being hospitalized even with severe COVID-19 illness, which might explain not being able to exclude a null effect for preventing hospitalization alone. Death alone is also problematic because, if residents are hospitalized or transferred, a subsequent death might not be recorded in the nursing home records. Therefore, the composite endpoint of death or hospitalization better described severe outcomes of COVID-19 than did either endpoint alone; however, each outcome was reported separately for interest. Third, the impact of one resident’s vaccination on the effectiveness of vaccination for other residents was not accounted for in this study which might underestimate the direct vaccine effect. Fourth, because of the relatively short follow-up time available for observation (60 days) it was not possible to evaluate potential waning of a second booster dose effect. Finally, the comparison of 4 versus 3 doses might also misclassify some persons who received additional doses because of an immunocompromised status as having received a booster dose. 

These results indicate that, compared with a single mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose, a second booster dose provided additional protection against COVID-19–associated severe outcomes among nursing home residents during the Omicron period ending with BA. 4 and BA. 5 dominances. The results support the importance of continued efforts to ensure the nursing home population is up to date on recommended COVID-19 vaccine booster doses including the newly authorized bivalent COVID-19 vaccine.","Corresponding author: Kevin W.

Abstract
Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited blood cell disorders that primarily affects Black or African American persons, is associated with severe complications and a >20-year reduction in life expectancy. In 2014, an expert panel convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute issued recommendations to prevent or reduce complications in children and adolescents with the most severe SCD subtypes, known as sickle cell anemia (SCA); recommendations included 1) annual screening of children and adolescents aged 2–16 years with transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to identify those at risk for stroke and 2) offering hydroxyurea therapy to children and adolescents aged ≥9 months to reduce the risk for several life-threatening complications.

Methods: Data from the IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database were analyzed. TCD screening and hydroxyurea use were examined for 3,352 children and adolescents with SCA aged 2–16 years and continuously enrolled in Medicaid during 2019. Percentage change during 2014–2019 and variation by health subgroups were assessed. Analyses were stratified by age.

Results: During 2014–2019, TCD screening increased 27% among children and adolescents aged 10–16 years; hydroxyurea use increased 27% among children aged 2–9 years and 23% among children and adolescents aged 10–16 years. However, in 2019, only 47% and 38% of children and adolescents aged 2–9 and 10–16 years, respectively, had received TCD screening and 38% and 53% of children and adolescents aged 2–9 years and 10–16 years, respectively, used hydroxyurea. For both prevention strategies, usage was highest among children and adolescents with high levels of health care utilization and evidence of previous complications indicative of severe disease.

Conclusion and Implications for Public Health Practice: Despite increases since 2014, TCD screening and hydroxyurea use remain low among children and adolescents with SCA. Health care providers should implement quality care strategies within their clinics and partner with patients, families, and community-based organizations to address barriers to delivering and receiving recommended care.

Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD), a group of inherited blood disorders characterized by abnormal hemoglobin, reduces life expectancy by >20 years (1). SCD primarily affects persons whose ancestors came from Africa, where malaria is endemic, because the carrier state (sickle cell trait, inheritance of a sickle cell gene from only one parent) confers a selective advantage by protecting against the harmful effects of malaria.* Thus, >90% of the estimated 100,000 persons in the United States with SCD are non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), and an estimated 3%–9% are Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) (2). In persons with SCD, red blood cells become rigid and deform into a crescent or sickle shape. Sickled cells die early and often become lodged in small blood vessels, compromising blood flow, which can lead to serious health problems. SCD-associated complications include anemia; acute and chronic pain; infections; pneumonia and acute chest syndrome†; stroke; and kidney, liver, and heart disease. Despite their extensive health care needs, many persons with SCD have difficulty accessing appropriate care and report feeling stigmatized and having their symptoms dismissed when they do seek care (3).

SCD comprises four main genotypes; among these, the hemoglobin SS and hemoglobin Sβ0-thalassemia genotypes are the more severe forms and are collectively referred to as sickle cell anemia (SCA). SCA accounts for an estimated 75% of SCD cases in the United States (4). In 2014, an expert panel convened by the National Institutes of Health’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) developed recommendations to prevent or reduce complications of SCD, several of which were specific to children and adolescents with SCA (5). Given that SCA is a common cause of childhood stroke (6), the panel recommended that children and adolescents aged 2–16 years with SCA be screened annually with transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to identify high cerebral blood velocity, an indicator of elevated stroke risk. Chronic blood transfusion therapy, the recommended intervention, substantially reduces stroke occurrence in children and adolescents identified as being at risk (7). The panel also recommended that children and adolescents aged ≥9 months with SCA (including asymptomatic children) be offered treatment with hydroxyurea, a medication shown to be efficacious in preventing or reducing severe pain episodes, acute chest syndrome, and other SCA-associated complications and increasing patient survival (8). Although the panel chose to recommend offering treatment as a means of opening discussion with families, it emphasized that an established evidence base supported the sustained benefits of hydroxyurea therapy for young persons with SCA without harmful effects on growth, development, female fertility, or increased risks for genetic mutations or cancer (5).

Previous studies documented underutilization of both TCD screening and hydroxyurea (9–11), and barriers to receipt of both interventions have been described (12–15). Barriers to TCD screening include limited radiology visit availability, distance between SCD clinics and radiology centers, providers’ lack of familiarity with TCD guidelines (including knowledge gaps among pediatric hematologists, neurologists, and primary care providers who care for children and adolescents with SCA), problems with care coordination (e.g., lack of timely information from radiology centers to providers), and provider concern that TCD screening will not affect outcomes because patients and families are often unable to sustain chronic blood transfusion therapy§ (12,13). Barriers to hydroxyurea use include patient and provider uncertainty regarding its effectiveness and fear of adverse effects (including perceived carcinogenesis potential), complexity of treatment regimen (which requires ongoing monitoring and laboratory visits), provider discomfort in managing hydroxyurea therapy, provider concern about lack of patient adherence, and high cost and lack of reimbursement (13–15). Recent studies on use of these prevention strategies are limited. This study examined TCD screening and hydroxyurea use among children and adolescents aged 2–16 years with SCA who were enrolled in Medicaid in 2019 and assessed changes since 2014.

Methods
This study was conducted using the IBM MarketScan Treatment Pathways online analytic tool with data from the IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database from January 1, 2010, to December 13, 2019, which includes medical claims data from approximately 24 million Medicaid enrollees from five to 15 states (the number of states varies by year). SCA was defined using an established algorithm, based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes, previously validated to identify persons with SCA (16,17) (Supplementary Box, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120746). TCD screening and hydroxyurea use were defined based on procedure and pharmacy codes, respectively. A small proportion (5%) of children and adolescents receiving chronic blood transfusion therapy were excluded from analyses because transfusion therapy might be indicative of previous abnormal TCD results and hydroxyurea and chronic blood transfusion therapy might not be used concurrently. The final analytic sample included 3,352 children and adolescents with SCA who were continuously enrolled in Medicaid in 2019. To assess change over time, a sample of 3,858 children and adolescents continuously enrolled in Medicaid in 2014 were compared with the 2019 sample; the two samples had similar demographic and health profiles (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120747).

The proportions of TCD screening and hydroxyurea use and their corresponding 95% CIs were calculated for children and adolescents in 2014 and 2019; percentage change from 2014 to 2019 was also calculated. Differences between years were considered statistically significant if CIs did not overlap. Findings were stratified by age group (2–9 years and 10–16 years) during the respective study year.

In the 2019 sample, TCD screening and hydroxyurea use were examined within health care usage and disease severity subgroups; associations were assessed using prevalence ratios and 95% CIs. Two indicators of severe disease were examined, each defined by whether the child or adolescent had a severe complication (acute chest syndrome or multiple pain crises) in 2019 or any previous data year (2010–2018) (Supplementary Box, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120746). Data analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶

Results
From 2014 to 2019, TCD screening increased 27% among children and adolescents aged 10–16 years. Among children aged 2–9 years, TCD screening increased 9%, which was not statistically significant. Nonetheless, younger children had higher TCD screening rates than did older children and adolescents in both years; by 2019, proportions of children and adolescents who had received TCD screening were 47% and 38% among those aged 2–9 and 10–16 years, respectively (Figure).

In both age groups, TCD screening varied significantly by health indicators (Table 1). Among children aged 2–9 years, the highest TCD screening rates (>55%) were among children who had a recent hospitalization, 11–20 recent ambulatory care visits, a recent or previous hospitalization for acute chest syndrome, or two or more pain crises requiring hospitalization in the current year or a previous year. Among children and adolescents aged 10–16 years, the highest TCD screening prevalences (43%–48%) were observed among the same subgroups.

From 2014 to 2019, hydroxyurea use increased significantly among children aged 2–9 years (27%) and children and adolescents aged 10–16 years (23%) (Figure). In 2019, hydroxyurea use was more prevalent among children and adolescents aged 10–16 years (53%) than among children aged 2–9 years (38%) and also varied significantly by health indicators (Table 2). Moreover, hydroxyurea use exceeded 60% among children and adolescents aged 10–16 years who had had a recent hospitalization, 11–30 recent ambulatory care visits, three or more recent emergency department visits, a recent or previous acute chest syndrome hospitalization, or two or more pain crises requiring hospitalization in the current year or a previous year. Among children aged 2–9 years, the prevalences of hydroxyurea use were highest (47%–58%) in the same subgroups, with one exception: there was little variation in hydroxyurea use by number of emergency department visits.","Although increases in both TCD screening and hydroxyurea use were observed during the 5 years after the NHLBI panel issued their recommendations (5), many children and adolescents with SCA were not receiving these potentially lifesaving interventions in 2019. Usage prevalences of both prevention strategies varied by age, with younger children less likely to use hydroxyurea and older children and adolescents less likely to have an annual TCD screen. Age differences were not explained by health characteristics: age prevalence patterns of both TCD screening and hydroxyurea use were consistent across all health care usage and disease severity subgroups examined. More specific reasons for the age differences cannot be examined with claims data. Usage of both prevention strategies was highest among children and adolescents with documentation of severe disease (i.e., those with manifest health care needs). Nonetheless, even among groups with the highest usage rates (younger children with an indication of severe disease for TCD screening and older children and adolescents with an indication of severe disease for hydroxyurea) a substantial proportion of children and adolescents for whom these interventions are indicated were not receiving them.

Previous studies document numerous barriers to receipt of both interventions (12–15). Promising quality-care initiatives to reduce some barriers have been reported. One SCD center leveraged electronic health records to enhance case management and improve TCD tracking and scheduling and enlisted support specialists to help young children remain relaxed during the procedure; they reported sustained increases in TCD screening, from 63% at baseline to >70% (18). A regional collaborative of SCD clinics reported a significant increase in hydroxyurea counseling (from 85% to 98%) after implementation of a program in which clinic staff members and families developed standardized approaches to track preventive care (19).

More than 90% of patients with SCD are Black, and 3%–9% are Hispanic (2); thus, racism and existing health care disparities compound barriers to care for children with SCA. Interpersonal racism, such as racist connotations, prejudice, discrimination, and bias toward patients with SCA, often results in inadequate care and prolonged suffering (3). Structural racism, policies that have led to unequal opportunities in housing, employment, health insurance, and research funding, keep disparities in place and contribute to adverse health outcomes. These challenges are exacerbated by poor access to health care for SCA, given the lack of providers with expertise or facilities with resources to treat SCA. Consequently, SCA patients might delay seeking care, and emergency department visits are common.

Preventing SCA-associated complications requires strategies to reduce racism and disparities. Health care providers can educate themselves, their colleagues, and their institutions about the unique and specific needs of persons with SCA, including how racism impedes optimal health care. They can advocate for and listen to their patients to better understand their needs. Population-based data are also critical to addressing gaps in health care. Data from the Sickle Cell Data Collection program, a state-based tracking system established by CDC in 2015 in California and Georgia, have directly informed health care decision-making. For example, a Georgia Sickle Cell Data Collection assessment that indicated that 10% of children and adolescents with SCD lived a >1-hour drive from any SCD specialty care option led to the opening of new mobile care clinics. Recently, the Sickle Cell Data Collection program expanded to 11 states, which collectively cover approximately 36% of persons with SCD in the United States.

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the sample for this analysis was limited to Medicaid enrollees from selected states; therefore findings are not generalizable to all U.S. children and adolescents with SCA. Nonetheless, previous assessments in two states indicate that most children and adolescents with SCD are covered by Medicaid.** Second, because the MarketScan Medicaid data files do not include information about which states participated each year, it was not possible to assess whether state variability partially explained changes in TCD screening and hydroxyurea use from 2014 to 2019. Third, socioeconomic data, such as income or parents’ level of education were also not available. Fourth, the SCA algorithm used in this study (16) maximized case-finding; thus, some children and adolescents with non-SCA genotypes might have been included in this analysis. However, the algorithm was most precise in classifying children and adolescents with SCA who had a previous severe complication, and the findings for those subgroups indicate that many children and adolescents with overt symptomatology are not receiving TCD screening or hydroxyurea. Finally, because hydroxyurea use was defined by the filling of a single prescription, the findings overestimate ongoing hydroxyurea use.

TCD screening is critical to stroke prevention in children and adolescents with SCA (7); hydroxyurea is efficacious in preventing serious complications (8), and numerous studies demonstrate the safety of its long-term use (20). The findings from this study highlight that health care for children and adolescents with SCA is fragmented. Health system accountability for evidence-based care can be built into electronic health records. Health care providers should implement quality care strategies to maximize TCD screening and hydroxyurea use and partner with patients, families, and community-based organizations to address barriers to care. Given that almost all SCA patients are Black or Hispanic (2), it is important that strategies include proactively addressing both interpersonal and structural racism. Finally, population-based surveillance data for SCA are currently limited to select states; expansion of surveillance coverage would allow CDC to better characterize disease outcomes and health care needs of those with SCA, and SCD overall, across the life span.","Corresponding author: Laura A.

HIV molecular cluster detection and response activities identify communities in which rapid transmission is occurring and help guide public health action. 

What is added by this report? 

Most large HIV molecular clusters of rapid transmission occurred among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). These clusters occurred in all regions of the country, grew rapidly, and varied in demographic characteristics, including race and ethnicity. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Responding swiftly to clusters is important to interrupting transmission. Understanding the diverse populations in HIV clusters among MSM is necessary for implementing tailored and robust response interventions, improving prevention and care services, and stopping transmission in affected communities.

Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 68% of new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2020* (1). Despite advances in treatment and prevention, HIV transmission among MSM continues, in part because of stigma and barriers to accessing prevention and treatment services (2). HIV cluster detection and response, a core strategy of the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the United States initiative,† is an important tool for early identification and response to rapid HIV transmission, including among MSM. To better understand rapid HIV transmission among this population, CDC characterized large HIV molecular clusters detected using analysis of HIV-1 nucleotide sequence data from the National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS).§ Among 38 such clusters first detected during 2018–2019 that had grown to include more than 25 persons by December 2021, 29 occurred primarily among MSM. Clusters primarily among MSM occurred in all geographic regions, and 97% involved multiple states. Clusters were heterogeneous in age, gender identity, and race and ethnicity and had rapid growth rates (median = nine persons added per year). The overall transmission rate at cluster detection was 22 transmission events per 100 person-years, more than six times that of previously estimated national transmission rates (3). Most clusters of rapid HIV transmission occur among MSM. Swift response to reach diverse persons and communities with early, tailored, and focused interventions is essential to reducing HIV transmission (4). 

Each calendar quarter, CDC analyzes HIV-1 polymerase (pol) sequences that are generated from routine HIV drug resistance testing as part of standard of care and reported to NHSS, to detect and notify jurisdictions of molecular clusters that are indicative of closely related transmission events and rapid transmission. Among persons with HIV infection diagnosed during the most recent 3 years, clusters are inferred using a pairwise threshold of 0.005 nucleotide substitutions per site; clusters of rapid transmission are those with five or more diagnoses during the most recent 12 months (5). Clusters first detected during 2018–2019 were examined, and large clusters were defined as those that had grown to include more than 25 persons as of December 2021. Each cluster was categorized according to the primary transmission category for persons in the cluster.¶ To better understand rapid transmission among MSM, further analysis was restricted to large clusters primarily involving MSM. Data reported through December 2021 were analyzed to describe these cluster characteristics and growth. 

Demographic characteristics, transmission category,** and geographic information (U.S. Census Bureau region†† and CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties§§) were described for all persons and clusters. Annual growth rates were calculated as the increase in the number of persons in each cluster divided by the number of years between date of detection and December 2021. For clusters primarily comprising subtype B sequences,¶¶ previously established methods were used to estimate HIV transmission rates at the time of cluster detection*** (5); transmission rates were reported as the number of transmission events per 100 person-years. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††† 

Among 136 HIV molecular clusters with rapid transmission first detected during 2018–2019, 38 (28%) clusters exceeded 25 persons by December 2021; these 38 clusters accounted for 1,533 (53%) of all 2,901 persons in the 136 molecular clusters. At that time, 29 (76%) of the 38 clusters primarily involved MSM, six (16%) primarily involved persons who inject drugs, and three (8%) had no identified primary transmission category. 

The 29 large clusters primarily among MSM included 985 persons, 52% of whom were aged 20–29 years at HIV diagnosis; 91% were male (Table 1). Thirty-four percent were Black or African American (Black) persons; 29% were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), and 29% were White. The most common transmission category was male-to-male sexual contact (MMSC) (77%); an additional 5% of persons reported MMSC and injection drug use. 

Approximately one half (48%) of persons in these 29 clusters lived in the South U.S. Census Bureau region, followed by 31% in the West, and 15% in the Northeast; 5% lived in the Midwest. Overall, 70% of persons lived in large central metropolitan or large fringe metropolitan areas at the time of HIV infection diagnosis, and 20% lived in medium metropolitan areas. 

As of December 2021, Black persons accounted for the largest racial or ethnic group in 13 (45%) large clusters among MSM, followed by White persons in nine (31%) clusters and Hispanic persons in seven (24%) (Table 2). In 14 (48%) clusters, the most common U.S. Census Bureau region was the South; 23 (79%) clusters included persons from more than one region. In 19 (66%) clusters, the most common area of residence was large central metropolitan; the second most common was medium metropolitan (seven clusters; 24%). Twenty-eight (97%) clusters involved persons in multiple states (median = four states; IQR = three to six states). 

Median cluster size at the time of detection was 11 persons (IQR = 8–12); median size as of December 2021 was 32 persons (IQR = 27–38) (Figure). Median annual growth rate was nine persons per year (IQR = six to 11). Among 23 subtype B clusters, transmission rates ranged from 11 to 140 transmission events per 100 person-years (IQR = 21–31); the transmission rate across all subtype B clusters was 22 transmission events per 100 person-years.","This analysis found that most large clusters of rapid HIV transmission in the United States occur primarily among MSM. Such clusters were characterized by rapid growth and transmission rates more than six times those of previously estimated national rates (3). 

The presence of an HIV cluster indicates a failure of treatment and prevention services to reach certain communities. HIV cluster detection and response activities can quickly identify rapid HIV transmission, including among MSM, and support early interventions that increase access to prevention and care services and improve health outcomes. These interventions should improve access and strengthen linkages to HIV testing, preexposure prophylaxis, and timely HIV treatment. Most clusters in this analysis were small at the time of detection, indicating an opportunity for these early interventions to uncover and address gaps in HIV services, remove any barriers to those services, and interrupt rapid transmission among MSM and others. 

A recent analysis indicated that the characteristics of persons in HIV molecular clusters can vary geographically and over time, and that molecular analysis identifies rapid transmission that might not be evident from other surveillance data (6). In this analysis, the disproportionate representation of Black and Hispanic MSM in these clusters mirrored disparities observed in national HIV surveillance data (1); however, the identification of clusters of rapid transmission provides a more local and nuanced understanding of diverse communities of MSM experiencing rapid transmission within larger heterogenous populations (e.g., all MSM). In addition to race and ethnicity, this analysis also identified variations in other characteristics of persons in large clusters primarily among MSM. While most persons in these clusters were cisgender men who reported MMSC, individual clusters also included transgender persons and persons who inject drugs. Health departments detecting and responding to these clusters can rapidly use data ascertained through cluster detection activities,§§§ as well as existing data sources (e.g., partner services data, other communicable disease surveillance data, and behavioral surveillance¶¶¶) or supplementary data collection (e.g., rapid needs assessments, qualitative interviews, and medical record abstraction), to better and more quickly understand affected populations and identify service gaps experienced by persons in these clusters (4,7). Gathering additional quantitative or qualitative data is important to understand and address the differing needs of persons in networks experiencing rapid transmission, including sexual, gender, and racial and ethnic minority groups involved in each cluster. 

These cluster-specific data can guide the rapid implementation of response interventions (4). For example, clusters involving both Black and Hispanic MSM would benefit from interventions that address the unique needs and barriers faced by each group, rather than more generalized response activities aimed at broader MSM groups. Further, for clusters that primarily involve MSM but also include persons who inject drugs, response interventions should include activities to prevent both sexual and injection-related transmission. Persons involved in the clusters represented in this analysis vary in their prevention and treatment needs, barriers to accessing services, and experiences of stigma and discrimination (4,7); a single intervention is unlikely to be appropriate for all cluster responses, or for all persons within a cluster. 

Clusters were detected in all regions of the country, and many included persons from multiple states, indicating the need for state and local health departments to be equipped to quickly detect and respond to clusters and collaborate with other health departments to address multistate clusters when indicated. CDC provides quarterly notification to jurisdictions about clusters of rapid transmission and supports health departments with guidance, tools, and technical assistance to implement cluster detection activities and build response programs**** that address the needs of MSM and others affected by HIV in their communities. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, incomplete HIV sequence reporting affects local and national cluster detection and characterization (8). Sequences were reported for approximately one half of diagnosed infections in recent years (6). Second, delays in sequence reporting can result in delayed cluster detection, artificially lowering estimates of growth rates for some clusters. Third, because sequences are available only for persons who have received an HIV diagnosis and entered care, persons in molecular clusters typically represent only a fraction of those in underlying transmission networks or in social networks who might have increased chances of acquiring HIV (4). Finally, this analysis does not include all clusters detected using other methods (4). 

Most large, rapidly growing HIV clusters occur primarily among MSM. Leveraging cluster data to rapidly identify and implement interventions when clusters are first detected is essential to stopping transmission. Many MSM face barriers to accessing HIV services because of stigma, homophobia, racism, xenophobia, poverty, and limitations in health insurance†††† (1,2). Successful response interventions should aim to eliminate these barriers, quickly close service gaps, and address existing and emerging syndemics affecting MSM, including sexually transmitted infections and monkeypox (9). When mobilized effectively, strategies that engage communities, improve prevention services, and strengthen linkage to care can address the needs of persons in HIV clusters.§§§§ Understanding the diverse populations affected by HIV clusters among MSM is necessary to implementing tailored and robust response interventions, stopping transmission, and preventing new HIV infections in this population.","Corresponding author: Stephen M.

Norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis is highly transmissible in settings with close person-to-person contact and decreased access to hand hygiene, such as backpacking or rafting. 

What is added by this report? 

During April 1–June 17, 2022, the largest outbreak of acute gastroenteritis documented in the Grand Canyon National Park backcountry occurred. At least 222 rafters and backpackers became infected, probably with norovirus. Strong partnerships with river outfitters and National Park staff members enabled implementation of prevention and control measures. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Outbreak control measures in the setting of rafting and backpacking include rapid case reporting, symptom screening before trip start, water disinfection, prompt separation of ill passengers, strict adherence to hand hygiene with soap and water, and minimizing interactions among rafting groups.

On May 11, 2022, the National Park Service (NPS) Office of Public Health (OPH) and Coconino County Health and Human Services (CCHHS) in Flagstaff, Arizona contacted CDC about a rising number of acute gastroenteritis cases among backcountry visitors to Grand Canyon National Park (Grand Canyon). The agencies reviewed illness report forms, assessed infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, and distributed a detailed survey to river rafters and hikers with backcountry permits (backpackers) who visited the Grand Canyon backcountry. During April 1–June 17, a total of 191 rafters and 31 backpackers reported symptoms consistent with acute gastroenteritis. Specimens from portable toilets used by nine river rafting trip groups were tested using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and test results were positive for norovirus. Norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis is highly transmissible in settings with close person-to-person contact and decreased access to hand hygiene, such as backpacking or rafting. IPC assessments led to recommendations for regular disinfection of potable water spigots throughout the backcountry, promotion of proper handwashing with soap and water when possible, and separation of ill persons from those who are not ill. Prevention and control of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks in the backcountry requires rapid reporting of illnesses, implementing IPC guidelines for commercial outfitters and river rafting launch points, and minimizing interactions among rafting groups. 

Commercially operated Colorado River rafting trips are allowed within the Grand Canyon during April–October (1). OPH surveillance of river rafting trip illnesses requires that guides on commercially operated trips report the occurrence of fewer than three illnesses at each trip’s end, contact the NPS by satellite phone as soon as possible when three or more illnesses occur (2), and complete an illness report form for each ill person. Private rafting trip guides must report illnesses within 7 days after completing the trip (3). Backpackers are encouraged to report illnesses. 

During April–May 2022, approximately 4,770 rafters visited the Grand Canyon backcountry.† On April 8, 2022, OPH was notified by a commercially operated rafting group within Grand Canyon of seven persons experiencing vomiting or diarrhea. After nine additional rafting trips (173 rafters), multiple cases of acute gastroenteritis were reported. OPH and CCHHS contacted CDC on May 11, 2022. By May 21, thirteen additional rafting trips with 102 reported cases of acute gastroenteritis were documented, and several backpackers reported symptoms consistent with acute gastroenteritis. A specific source of virus transmission had not been identified. On May 24, 2022, NPS requested CDC assistance, and an investigation was initiated. 

A case of acute gastroenteritis was defined as vomiting or diarrhea (at least three loose stools during a 24-hour period) <24 hours before trip launch through 3 days after the end of the trip in a person who participated in a river rafting trip or backcountry backpacking in the Grand Canyon during April 1–June 17, 2022. A detailed survey was distributed by email to all backpackers, river rafters on private and commercially operated trips with one or more ill persons, and river rafters on commercial trips with no reported ill persons during the same period. Survey responses were linked to illness report forms of previously reported illnesses to deduplicate. The survey closed on July 8, 2022. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§ 

Among 116 illness report forms collected through July 8, 2022, a total of 94 (81%) rafters reported vomiting, 79 (68%) reported diarrhea, and 74 (64%) reported nausea. Acute onset, short symptom duration (median 24 hours), and predominance of vomiting suggested norovirus. CCHHS coordinated with the University of Arizona to test portable toilets for norovirus using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (4) with specimens from nine affected rafting trips and two unaffected trips. Pooled portable toilet specimens from each of the nine affected trips were positive for norovirus, including two specimens from river rafting trips that started in April 2022 (genotype 1) and seven specimens from river rafting trips that started in May 2022 (genotype 2). None of the pooled specimens from the portable toilets used during the two unaffected trips tested positive for norovirus. Portable toilet specimens were not tested for other pathogens. 

The date of first illness onset among rafters was April 6, 2022; the trip had an attack rate of 39% (11 of 28 rafters). Rafting trip attack rates ranged from 10% (three of 31) to 83% (29 of 35). During April 1–June 17, 2022, a total of 222 persons had an illness that met the case definition for acute gastroenteritis (Table) (Figure). Most respondents reported illness onset during the trip (178; 80%), with five persons from separate trips (two river rafters and three backpackers) reporting illness onset <24 hours before their trip started (different illness onset dates). Most cases occurred among park visitors (191; 86%) and the remaining cases (31; 14%) among professional guides.¶ Ill visitors were from 34 U.S. states and four additional countries. Among 222 acute gastroenteritis cases, 160 (72%) persons completed the electronic survey and provided sufficient information for further analysis (Table). Most (73%) illness onsets occurred during May 1–20, 2022. Survey response collection ended on July 8, 2022, with 1,327 visitors to the Grand Canyon backcountry completing at least a portion of the survey. Further analysis is underway to examine epidemiologic overlap among ill and non-ill rafters and backpackers who completed the survey. 

Public health partners shared norovirus IPC education messages tailored to the backcountry environment immediately after notification (Figure). This included recommendations for symptom screening and exclusion of ill-persons from joining a rafting trip, disinfection of potable water, separation of ill persons from healthy persons, enhanced environmental cleaning, and strict precautions for food storage and preparation on river rafts in addition to environmental inspections of the commercial outfitters’ warehouses. OPH staff members conducted a site visit at Phantom Ranch** (a common exchange point) on May 13, 2022, and made recommendations for daily disinfection of the two potable water spigots using a chlorine solution and placement of mechanical backflow prevention devices between animal drinking trough hoses and potable water supply hoses. Frequent communication occurred among commercial outfitters, the backcountry office, and public health agencies to expedite information exchange, including the sharing of portable toilet test results. 

NPS posted multiple acute gastroenteritis website alerts†† to provide prevention education beginning on May 16, 2022, including a link to CDC’s Norovirus and Safe Drinking Water webpages.§§ Outfitter staff members were advised to promote handwashing with soap and water, monitor adherence, and isolate or cohort persons with acute gastroenteritis during the trip whenever possible. Many outfitter staff members were unaware that alcohol-based hand sanitizer is ineffective in mitigating norovirus transmission (5). OPH and CDC conducted a site visit to the Lees Ferry raft launch point on June 3, 2022 and recommended adding signs to promote handwashing in restrooms, displaying acute gastroenteritis outbreak information on bulletin boards throughout the backcountry, and increasing the frequency of cleaning restrooms and disinfecting the potable water spigot, a highly used water source by rafters and day visitors.","A large norovirus-associated outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred in the Grand Canyon backcountry among river rafters and backpackers during April–June 2022. Preliminary analyses of illness characteristics and portable toilet specimen test results suggested norovirus as the primary causative agent of illness. Norovirus spreads quickly through person-to-person contact and contaminated food or beverages, and can persist in the environment (5). Five persons reported illness onset <24 hours before their trips were launched and two genotypes were identified from portable toilet specimens of affected trips, indicating a potential for multisource introduction of norovirus into the river corridor. Analyses of survey responses are underway to identify epidemiologic overlap, including food and beverages, river stop locations, backcountry toilet use, and other factors. 

Illness reports slowed before the arrival of the CDC team on May 31, 2022. The close relationship among outfitters and public health authorities likely facilitated rapid communication about the rise in acute gastroenteritis cases that resulted in more vigilant warnings during pretrip passenger briefings and an internal reinforcement of environmental protection and equipment sanitation guidelines (2). The last report of acute gastroenteritis occurred on June 17, 2022. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, although no individual specimens were available for testing, test results from pooled portable toilets suggest norovirus as a primary contributor to this outbreak. Second, the total number of illnesses associated with this outbreak is likely underreported. OPH has adapted sanitation standards and IPC recommendations to meet the unique setting of river rafting and backcountry camping trips. Some acute gastroenteritis, including norovirus, is expected on rafting and hiking trips (6). Norovirus is highly infectious and has a low infective dose (5). Because many trips use the same campsites and place portable toilets in the same locations, particles could have been transmitted to surfaces, beach sand, or river water where new groups could have encountered them, and then transmitted the virus both from person-to-person and trip-to-trip. Rapid separation of ill persons from non-ill persons and reinforcement of hygiene and sanitation practices by commercial rafting trip guides might have led to lower attack rates reported on some trips. 

Previous norovirus outbreaks have occurred among river rafters in Grand Canyon associated with contaminated food products (7) and person-to-person transmission (8) resulting in recommendations to adhere to strict hygiene guidance. An increase in norovirus activity was observed at a national level in spring 2022, with the number of outbreak reports returning to prepandemic levels for the first time since March 2020 (9). 

With norovirus increasing nationwide and visitation rates returning to near prepandemic levels (10), the potential exists for resurgence of norovirus outbreaks among visitors to the Grand Canyon backcountry. River rafting and camping might amplify norovirus spread because of limited hygiene supplies and close person-to-person contact. Prevention and control of future outbreaks includes rapid reporting of illnesses, symptom screening before trip launch to minimize introduction of illnesses, strict adherence to hand hygiene with soap and water and sanitation protocols, disinfection of water before consumption, prompt separation of ill passengers, and minimizing of interactions with other rafting groups.","Corresponding author: Ariella P.

Monkeypox virus (MPXV) typically causes a febrile illness with lymphadenopathy and a diffuse vesiculopustular rash; neurologic complications are rare. The current monkeypox outbreak differs clinically and epidemiologically from previous outbreaks, and little is known about potential associated neurologic complications. 

What is added by this report? 

Two U.S. cases of encephalomyelitis associated with acute MPXV infection were identified during summer 2022. Whether the underlying pathophysiology resulted from direct viral neuroinvasion or a parainfectious autoimmune process is currently unknown. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Suspected cases of neurologic complications of monkeypox should be reported to state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments to improve understanding of the range of clinical manifestations of MPXV infections during the current outbreak and treatment options.

Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is an orthopoxvirus in the Poxviridae family. The current multinational monkeypox outbreak has now spread to 96 countries that have not historically reported monkeypox, with most cases occurring among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (1,2). The first monkeypox case in the United States associated with this outbreak was identified in May 2022 in Massachusetts (1); monkeypox has now been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and one U.S. territory. MPXV is transmitted by close contact with infected persons or animals; infection results in a febrile illness followed by a diffuse vesiculopustular rash and lymphadenopathy. However, illness in the MPXV current Clade II outbreak has differed: the febrile prodrome is frequently absent or mild, and the rash often involves genital, anal, or oral regions (3,4). Although neuroinvasive disease has been previously reported with MPXV infection (5,6), it appears to be rare. This report describes two cases of encephalomyelitis in patients with monkeypox disease that occurred during the current U.S. outbreak. Although neurologic complications of acute MPXV infections are rare, suspected cases should be reported to state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments to improve understanding of the range of clinical manifestations of and treatment options for MPXV infections during the current outbreak. 

Details of two cases of encephalomyelitis associated with monkeypox in previously healthy young gay men in Colorado and DC are presented in this report. The University of Colorado and Georgetown University determined that this report was not subject to human subjects review because it includes only information obtained for purposes of patient clinical care and public health outbreak response. This activity was also reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.† 


Patient A 
The first case occurred in a previously healthy, presumedly immunocompetent gay man in his 30s in Colorado (patient A). He had no recognized MPXV exposure or recent travel. He was not previously vaccinated against monkeypox or smallpox. In July 2022, he acutely developed fever, chills, and malaise. Three days after symptom onset, an itchy vesiculopustular rash appeared on his face and spread to his extremities and scrotum during the next several days. Swabs of a lesion yielded a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result for Orthopoxvirus DNA, later confirmed to be MPXV DNA. Nine days after symptom onset, the patient developed progressive left upper and lower extremity weakness and numbness, urinary retention, and intermittent priapism, and was hospitalized. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed partially enhancing lesions in the frontal lobes consistent with demyelination as well as nonenhancing lesions of the bilateral basal ganglia, bilateral medial thalami, splenium, and pons (Figure 1). MRI of the spine showed multifocal, longitudinally extensive, partially enhancing lesions of the central thoracic spinal cord and gray matter of the conus medullaris, with a single cervical level of canal stenosis with partial cord compression (presumably chronic and not acute). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated 155 white blood cells/μL (normal = ≤5) with 60% lymphocytes, 30% monocytes, and 10% neutrophils; 9 red blood cells/μL (normal = 0); glucose 64 mg/dL (normal = 45–80 mg/dL); and protein 273 mg/dL (normal = 15–45 mg/dL). CSF bacterial cultures were negative. CSF herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) PCR test results were negative. No CSF-specific oligoclonal bands (a marker for central nervous system [CNS] inflammation) were present. Serum aquaporin-4 (to evaluate for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [NMOSD]§) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (to evaluate for MOG antibody–associated disease [MOGAD]¶) antibody test results were negative. Serum HIV serologic and PCR test results were negative. Serum treponemal antibodies and particle agglutination test results were positive; serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and CSF venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test results were negative, suggesting a past syphilis infection (patient A received a single dose of penicillin after an exposure in 2013). SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–PCR nasopharyngeal swab test result was negative, and serum and CSF MPXV PCR test results were negative. 

Treatment with oral tecovirimat began immediately after the onset of neurologic symptoms. Subsequently, pulsed intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (for suspected demyelination and spinal cord edema), IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) (for a possible parainfectious autoimmune process), and IV penicillin (for empiric syphilis treatment in case of a latent infection) were added to the patient’s regimen, with partial improvement in numbness and weakness over several days. After 2 weeks, the patient’s improvement plateaued with continued left leg weakness. Given concern for possible continued spinal cord inflammation, plasma exchange (PLEX) was initiated, and the patient’s leg weakness improved. His skin lesions resolved over 3 weeks. He was discharged to outpatient rehabilitation therapy and was ambulatory with an assistive walking device at 1 month follow-up. He was also referred to outpatient neurosurgery for his presumed chronic cervical spinal canal stenosis. 


Patient B 
The second case of MPXV-associated encephalomyelitis occurred in a previously healthy, presumedly immunocompetent gay man in his 30s in DC (patient B). He had no known MPXV exposure or recent travel. He had not been vaccinated against monkeypox and his smallpox vaccination status was uncertain. In July 2022, he acutely developed fever and myalgia, which was followed by eruption of a diffuse vesiculopustular rash involving his face, extremities, trunk, and perianal area. Swabs of a lesion yielded positive Orthopoxvirus DNA PCR test results, later confirmed to be MPXV DNA. Five days after symptom onset, he developed bowel and bladder incontinence and progressive flaccid weakness of both lower extremities and was hospitalized. His condition progressed to altered mental status and obtundation during the next 2 days. He was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the intensive care unit. MRI of the brain showed nonenhancing lesions of the pons, cerebellum, and medulla without restricted diffusion (Figure 2). MRI of the spine showed multifocal, partially enhancing lesions in the central cervical and upper thoracic regions (Figure 2). Computed tomography imaging of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated rectal thickening with pelvic lymphadenopathy consistent with proctitis, thought to be related to MPXV infection. CSF analysis demonstrated 30 white blood cells/μL with 89% lymphocytes and 11% monocytes; 4 red blood cells/μL, glucose 65 mg/dL, and protein 60 mg/dL. CSF bacterial cultures and CSF HSV and VZV PCR results were negative. Three CSF-specific oligoclonal bands were present. Serum and CSF aquaporin-4 and MOG antibody test results were negative. Serum HIV serologic and PCR test results were negative, as were serum RPR and CSF VDRL test results and rectal and urine gonorrhea and chlamydia screening results. SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–PCR nasopharyngeal swab test result was negative at admission and when febrile. CSF MPXV PCR test result was negative. 

The patient started treatment with oral tecovirimat via nasogastric tube 2 days after neurologic symptom onset but quickly transitioned to IV tecovirimat over concerns for potential absorption issues. Because of concern for spinal cord edema, pulsed IV methylprednisolone was given with no immediate clinical improvement in weakness, but mild improvement in cognition. A parainfectious autoimmune process was considered, and IVIG was started. However, the patient subsequently developed high fevers, leading to discontinuation of IVIG after 2 days of treatment. A course of PLEX was initiated and the patient began to substantially improve. After five sessions of PLEX, he was extubated, was speaking and following commands, and had improvement in his lower extremity weakness. His proctitis resolved and his skin lesions healed by 5 weeks. He was given IV rituximab, a monoclonal antibody medication, for maintenance immunosuppressive therapy and was discharged to acute inpatient rehabilitation, ambulating with an assistive walking device. 

","Patients A and B had confirmed systemic MPXV infections with encephalomyelitis appearing within 5 and 9 days, respectively, of illness onset. The underlying pathology behind this is unclear but might represent either MPXV invasion of the CNS or a parainfectious autoimmune process triggered by systemic MPXV infection. Both patients had some clinical and radiographic features of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), typically a monophasic parainfectious autoimmune demyelinating disease of the CNS that primarily affects children but can also occur in adults (7). In past centuries, ADEM-like syndromes have been described in patients with presumed Variola virus infections (i.e., smallpox) (8,9). 

In this report, neither patient was found to have MPXV nucleic acid in the CSF, which would have proven MPXV neuroinvasion. However, absence of detectable nucleic acid in the CSF is not uncommon among CNS viral infections. A CSF Orthopoxvirus immunoglobulin (Ig) M test for detection of virus-specific IgM antibodies, which could suggest viral neuroinvasion, was not performed because this test was not Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)–certified at the time of this report. Results of tests to look for the autoimmune CNS conditions NMOSD and MOGAD were negative. In patient A, neither the rash nor the neurologic condition was thought to be consistent with an active syphilis infection, and the cervical spinal canal stenosis did not fully explain his clinical condition. 

Given that the pathologic mechanism for encephalomyelitis in these two instances is unknown, the best diagnostic workup and treatment course for similar cases is unclear. For severe MPXV disease, tecovirimat is recommended as first-line antiviral therapy, although the degree of CNS penetration is unknown (10). For significant edema, demyelination, or an ADEM-like presentation, corticosteroids can be considered, although benefits should be weighed against the immunosuppressive risks during an active infection. In addition, for a suspected parainfectious autoimmune CNS process or ADEM-like presentation, empiric IVIG or PLEX (or PLEX followed by IVIG) can be considered (7). The role for anti-B–cell therapies such as rituximab is not known. 

Clinicians and public health professionals should be aware of the range of possible clinical presentations of MPXV infections and potential treatments. Suspected cases should be reported to state, tribal, local, or territorial health departments to improve understanding of the range of clinical manifestations of MPXV infections and treatment options. Persons who have been exposed to monkeypox or are at higher risk of being exposed may be vaccinated against monkeypox to reduce the chance of disease and can consider other protective measures to reduce their risk for exposure to MPXV.**","Corresponding author: Daniel M.

In April 2020, the incidence of norovirus outbreaks in the United States declined substantially, likely because of implementation of COVID-19–related nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as facility closures, social distancing, and increased hand hygiene (2). Similar declines were observed in other countries (3,4). Norovirus outbreaks in the United States increased rapidly starting in January 2022, approaching prepandemic (i.e., 2012–2019) levels. Norovirus transmission can be prevented by thorough handwashing and proper cleaning and disinfection of contaminated surfaces. 

In 2012, CDC established the Norovirus Sentinel Testing and Tracking Network (NoroSTAT) to improve timeliness and completeness of surveillance for norovirus outbreaks that occur in the United States. NoroSTAT is a collaboration between CDC and 12 state health departments.* Outbreaks are defined as two or more cases of illness associated with a common exposure. NoroSTAT-participating states report a minimum set of data elements† to the National Outbreak Reporting System§ for all confirmed norovirus outbreaks (i.e., outbreaks with two or more laboratory-confirmed norovirus cases) and suspected norovirus outbreaks (i.e., outbreaks with fewer than two laboratory-confirmed norovirus cases) within 7 business days of notification. These states also upload typing information for norovirus-positive outbreak specimens to CaliciNet,¶ the national norovirus laboratory surveillance network, within 7 business days of receipt of two outbreak-associated norovirus-positive stool specimens at the respective state public health laboratory. Outbreak reports are organized into surveillance years (i.e., August 1–July 31) based on the state funding cycle.** 

During the 2021–2022 surveillance year (August 1, 2021–July 31, 2022), the 12 NoroSTAT-participating states reported 992 norovirus outbreaks to CDC (Figure). In comparison, the same states reported 1,056 and 343 norovirus outbreaks during the 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 surveillance years, respectively. The number of norovirus outbreaks reported by these states during prepandemic surveillance years ranged from 1,219 (2015–2016) to 1,471 (2018–2019). Norovirus outbreak characteristics reported by NoroSTAT-participating states during 2021–2022 were similar to those reported during prepandemic years. Most outbreaks (82%) were due to person-to-person spread (prepandemic range = 71%–85%). The majority (59%) of outbreaks occurred in long-term care facilities (prepandemic range = 53%–68%); 17% were laboratory-confirmed (prepandemic range = 22%–48%). Among laboratory-confirmed outbreaks with typing information during 2021–2022, a total of 43% were GII.4 Sydney(P16), which has been the predominant norovirus strain since its emergence during 2015–2016 (5). 

The number of norovirus outbreaks that NoroSTAT-participating states reported during the 2021–2022 surveillance year was nearly three times the number reported during the 2020–2021 surveillance year. Nonpharmaceutical interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were likely effective in preventing outbreaks of other infectious diseases, including norovirus. As the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions has relaxed, norovirus outbreak incidence has returned to levels similar to those during prepandemic surveillance years, and GII.4 viruses continue to cause the largest proportion of norovirus outbreaks. Norovirus transmission can be prevented by handwashing thoroughly with soap and water, avoiding food preparation until ≥48 hours after symptoms end, and proper cleaning and disinfection of surfaces contaminated by vomitus or diarrhea.††",N/A,"Corresponding author: Anita K.

Recent reports have suggested a possible increase in pediatric streptococcal brain abscesses, epidural empyemas, and subdural empyemas. 

What is added by this report? 

After a decline in cases at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, cases increased during summer 2021, peaked in March 2022, and then declined to baseline levels. Clinical presentation and microbiological features were stable during this period. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Initial reports from clinicians are consistent with seasonal fluctuations and a redistribution of cases over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. No evidence of increased case severity, genetic relatedness of streptococcal isolates from different cases, or increased antimicrobial resistance was identified. Epidemiologic monitoring is continuing.

In May 2022, CDC learned of three children in California hospitalized concurrently for brain abscess, epidural empyema, or subdural empyema caused by Streptococcus intermedius. Discussions with clinicians in multiple states raised concerns about a possible increase in pediatric intracranial infections, particularly those caused by Streptococcus bacteria, during the past year and the possible contributing role of SARS-CoV-2 infection (1). Pediatric bacterial brain abscesses, epidural empyemas, and subdural empyemas, rare complications of respiratory infections and sinusitis, are often caused by Streptococcus species but might also be polymicrobial or caused by other genera, such as Staphylococcus. On June 9, CDC asked clinicians and health departments to report possible cases of these conditions and to submit clinical specimens for laboratory testing. Through collaboration with the Children’s Hospital Association (CHA), CDC analyzed nationally representative pediatric hospitalizations for brain abscess and empyema. Hospitalizations declined after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, increased during summer 2021 to a peak in March 2022, and then declined to baseline levels. After the increase in summer 2021, no evidence of higher levels of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, genetic relatedness of isolates from different patients, or increased antimicrobial resistance of isolates was observed. The peak in cases in March 2022 was consistent with historical seasonal fluctuations observed since 2016. Based on these findings, initial reports from clinicians (1) are consistent with seasonal fluctuations and a redistribution of cases over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC will continue to work with investigation partners to monitor ongoing trends in pediatric brain abscesses and empyemas. 

Two data sources were analyzed: 1) pediatric hospitalizations for brain abscesses, epidural empyemas, and subdural empyemas reported to CHA’s Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) and 2) cases reported to CDC in response to a national call for cases. With CHA, CDC examined hospitalizations at 40 tertiary referral children’s hospitals across the United States that consistently reported data to PHIS during January 1, 2016–May 31, 2022 (the most recent data available when the analysis was performed). All inpatient encounters from patients aged ≤18 years with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code G06.0 (intracranial abscess and granuloma) or G06.2 (extradural and subdural abscess, unspecified) during the study period were included. Concurrent COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as having International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes U07.1 or B97.29 on the discharge diagnosis list. Medical complexity was classified according to the Pediatric Medical Complexity Algorithm (2). 

In CDC’s national call for cases, a case was defined as the diagnosis of brain abscess, epidural empyema, or subdural empyema in a person aged ≤18 years without a previous neurosurgical procedure or history of head trauma, hospitalized on or after June 1, 2021, irrespective of etiology. The call for cases was shared with health departments and two provider listservs.* Reports received after August 10, 2022, were excluded. Available Streptococcus specimens isolated from a brain abscess, epidural empyema, subdural empyema, blood, or cerebrospinal fluid were collected for antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing at CDC’s Streptococcus reference laboratory to identify microbiological features shared among cases. Genomic sequences were generated with an Illumina Miseq (3) instrument, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified for core genomes employing kSNP3.0 with k-mer size of 19 (4). Pairwise comparisons were generated employing Mega7 (5). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (6). The agar diffusion gradient method (Etest, bioMérieux) was used for isolates that did not grow in broth. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) or R (version 4.0.3; R Foundation) with R Studio (version 1.3.1093; RStudio, PBC).This study was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with federal law and CDC policy.† 

Cases Identified Through CHA’s PHIS Database 
During January 2016–May 2022, a total of 3,078 cases of pediatric brain abscesses, epidural empyemas, or subdural empyemas were identified from the PHIS database, ranging from 20 to 68 cases per month (median = 38; IQR = 32–48) (Figure). Beginning in April 2020, case counts were below the median for 15 months, the longest such interval during the analysis period. Starting in summer 2021, cases increased and peaked in March 2022, representing the longest interval with case counts above the median, before declining in April 2022. During these two periods, 184 fewer and 177 more cases occurred, respectively, than would have, if each month had had the median number of cases. Since 2016, peaks in cases have often occurred around March, with similarly sized peaks observed in March 2017 and March 2019. Although the total number of cases in 2020 (382) was lower than that during 2016–2019 (range = 443–538), the total in 2021 (471) was within this historical range. 

The median patient age was 8 years (IQR = 1–13 years). Most cases (65.1%) occurred in males; 46.5% of cases were in non-Hispanic White (White), 21.3% in non-Hispanic Black, 20.8% in Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), 3.3% in non-Hispanic Asian children, and 8.1% in non-Hispanic children of another race. The demographic characteristics of patients remained largely consistent over time, as did markers of severity (e.g., length of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, and ICU admission) and the percentage of patients with a complex chronic condition (Supplementary Figure 1; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120876) (Supplementary Figure 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120877) (Supplementary Figure 3; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120878). The percentage of patients with concurrent COVID-19 varied from 1.3% to 10.9% across quarters (Supplementary Figure 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120877) paralleling known COVID-19 waves.§ 

Cases Identified Through CDC’s National Call for Cases 
Among the 94 possible cases of pediatric brain abscesses, epidural empyemas, or subdural empyemas reported after CDC’s national call for cases, 81 met the case definition. The median patient age was 11 years (IQR = 6–13 years) (Table). Cases were most frequently reported in males (61.3%) and White (54.5%) children. Forty-five percent of cases occurred in children with underlying health conditions, with asthma (11.5%) being the most common. Among patients, 61.0% had a diagnosis of at least one respiratory infection in the 6 weeks before hospitalization, most commonly sinusitis (26.0%) or COVID-19 (18.2%). Most patients (81.8%) sought outpatient care for the illness episode before hospitalization. Subdural empyema was the most common case presentation (53.1%), followed by brain abscess (37.0%) and epidural empyema (33.3%). Among 71 patients who were no longer hospitalized at the time of reporting, two (2.8%) died. Case report data indicated that streptococcal species were identified in most (92.1%) isolates, commonly S. intermedius (41.6%) and Streptococcus anginosus (18.4%). Nonstreptococcal species, including 15 unique pathogens, were isolated in 28.9% of cases and in all cases with polymicrobial infections. 

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on available Streptococcus specimens (two Streptococcus constellatus and 16 S. intermedius) to identify shared microbiological features among cases. Both S. constellatus isolates were intermediately resistant to ampicillin, but susceptible to other antimicrobials tested.¶ Nine S. intermedius isolates were pan-susceptible. One isolate was resistant to tetracycline only. Four S. intermedius isolates displayed a 1.5 μg/mL MIC against vancomycin, slightly above the clinical breakpoint for susceptibility (≤1 μg/mL) and were susceptible to other antimicrobials tested. Two isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics (erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline) and intermediately resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin, one of which also displayed a 1.5 μg/mL MIC against vancomycin. Among 15 sequenced S. intermedius isolates, the average core genome pairwise distance was approximately 6,200 SNPs, indicating genetic unrelatedness. 

","Nationally representative hospitalizations during January 2016–May 2022, indicate that the number of pediatric brain abscess, epidural empyema, and subdural empyema cases in 2021 were within historical limits. High case counts in March 2022 were consistent with seasonal peaks in cases observed in March since 2016, but not previously reported. Cases declined in April 2022 and reached the median level by May 2022. Based on these findings, initial reports from clinicians (1) are consistent with seasonal fluctuations and a redistribution of cases over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. The finding that S. intermedius and S. constellatus isolates were largely susceptible to tested antimicrobials is consistent with published reports (7,8). 

Pediatric brain abscess, epidural empyema, and subdural empyema are often preceded by respiratory infection, including in 61.0% of cases reported to CDC, although previous COVID-19 was only reported in 18.2%. The extended period with case numbers below the January 2016–May 2022 median after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a peak in cases during late 2021–early 2022, might reflect altered patterns of respiratory pathogen transmission during the pandemic. Other studies have reported decreased incidences of respiratory and streptococcal infections in children coinciding with the implementation of pandemic-related nonpharmaceutical interventions, which were followed by returns to or rebounds past prepandemic baselines after COVID-19 mitigation measures were relaxed (9,10). Pediatric brain abscesses and empyemas are serious infections always requiring hospitalization; thus, it is unlikely that the observed trends are the result of altered detection of cases from disruptions to the medical system during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, microbiologic etiology could not be identified from the PHIS hospitalization data. Second, PHIS data reported case numbers, not rates over time. Third, PHIS data from tertiary children’s hospitals might not reflect all hospitals admitting children. Fourth, levels of completeness of case report form variables from CDC’s call for cases varied. Whereas COVID-19 diagnosis before hospitalization was of particular interest, this information might not have been reliably available to medical record abstractors. Finally, selection bias could have occurred in the identification and reporting of cases from CDC’s call for cases. In particular, the phrasing of the call for cases, which highlighted streptococcal species as a potential etiology, might have resulted in underreporting of cases with other etiologies. 

Through collaboration with state and local health departments, clinicians, laboratorians, and academic partners, this investigation examined multiyear nationally representative hospitalization data, a large case series with detailed clinical information, and microbiologic features of Streptococcus sp. isolated from patients with a diagnosis of brain abscess, epidural empyema, or subdural empyema. After a comparative increase in cases from previous years that began in summer 2021, no evidence of increased case severity, genetic relatedness of streptococcal isolates from different cases, or antimicrobial resistance beyond what is typical for streptococcal species was identified. Case numbers peaked in March 2022, consistent with historical, seasonal fluctuations and declined to baseline in subsequent months. CDC will continue to work with investigation partners to monitor ongoing trends in pediatric brain abscesses and empyemas.","Corresponding author: Emma K.

Although risk for monkeypox transmission to health care personnel (HCP) is thought to be low, CDC recommends that HCP wear personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of gown, gloves, eye protection, and an N95 (or higher-level) respirator while caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox. 

What is added by this report? 

Among 313 Colorado HCP exposed to patients with monkeypox, recommended PPE use and receipt of postexposure prophylaxis vaccination was low. HCP were assessed for risk and actively monitored for 21 days when indicated; none acquired monkeypox. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

The risk for acquiring monkeypox among U.S. HCP after exposure to patients with monkeypox is very low. HCP in all health care settings can benefit from public health outreach regarding infection prevention education and training.

The risk for monkeypox transmission to health care personnel (HCP) caring for symptomatic patients is thought to be low but has not been thoroughly assessed in the context of the current global outbreak (1). Monkeypox typically spreads through close physical (often skin-to-skin) contact with lesions or scabs, body fluids, or respiratory secretions of a person with an active monkeypox infection. CDC currently recommends that HCP wear a gown, gloves, eye protection, and an N95 (or higher-level) respirator while caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox to protect themselves from infection† (1,2). The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) evaluated HCP exposures and personal protective equipment (PPE) use in health care settings during care of patients who subsequently received a diagnosis of Orthopoxvirus infection (presumptive monkeypox determined by a polymerase chain reaction [PCR] DNA assay) or monkeypox (real-time PCR assay and genetic sequencing performed by CDC). During May 1–July 31, 2022, a total of 313 HCP interacted with patients with subsequently diagnosed monkeypox infections while wearing various combinations of PPE; 23% wore all recommended PPE during their exposures. Twenty-eight percent of exposed HCP were considered to have had high- or intermediate-risk exposures and were therefore eligible to receive postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with the JYNNEOS vaccine§; among those, 48% (12% of all exposed HCP) received the vaccine. PPE use varied by facility type: HCP in sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics and community health centers reported the highest adherence to recommended PPE use, and primary and urgent care settings reported the lowest adherence. No HCP developed a monkeypox infection during the 21 days after exposure. These results suggest that the risk for transmission of monkeypox in health care settings is low. Infection prevention training is important in all health care settings, and these findings can guide future updates to PPE recommendations and risk classification in health care settings. 

CDPHE collected data on clinical and nonclinical HCP exposed by treating, being within 6 feet of, or handling linens from a patient who subsequently received a diagnosis of monkeypox in health care settings during May 1–July 31, 2022. CDPHE interviewed patients with monkeypox and reviewed medical records to ascertain whether lesions were present during health care exposures. HCP who had cared for out-of-state patients or for patients who were lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Exposure details, including types of PPE worn, types of interaction, and amount of time spent with the patient were collected for each HCP, and risk levels were assigned using the CDC HCP risk assessment criteria at the time (low or uncertain, intermediate, or high). HCP with high- or intermediate-risk exposures were offered JYNNEOS PEP vaccination and were actively monitored for symptoms for 21 days after the exposure.¶ HCP with low-risk exposures were asked to self-monitor for symptoms for 21 days.** HCP who experienced symptoms were asked to notify CDPHE immediately, were excluded from work until symptoms resolved, and received Orthopoxvirus testing if rash or lesions occurred. All HCP included in the analysis completed the 21-day monitoring period. In addition, facilities reported all exposure, PPE, and exposure risk data to CDPHE. PEP administration data were obtained from reporting facilities and through the Colorado Immunization Information System. These data were summarized and stratified by facility type and job title. Analyses were completed using R statistical software (version 2021.09.2; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† 

During May 1–July 31, 2022, a total of 313 HCP were exposed to 55 patients with monkeypox, including 20 high-risk, 67 intermediate-risk, and 226 low- or uncertain-risk exposures (Table). Seven HCP had exposure during aerosol-generating procedures; three of whom wore an N95 respirator during their exposure. Overall, 273 (87%) exposures to patients with monkeypox rash or lesions occurred, and 161 (59%) included direct contact with the patient’s skin or lesions (gloves were worn in 125 exposures, were not worn in 30 exposures, and use of gloves was unknown for six exposures). Twenty-six (8%) exposed HCP reported handling linens; 23 (88%) of whom were wearing gloves. Approximately two thirds of encounters with monkeypox patients (215; 69%) lasted 5–30 minutes. Only one health care worker was exposed for >3 hours; this health care worker wore an N95 respirator and all other recommended PPE for the duration of the exposure. 

Among the 313 exposed HCP, 118 (38%) reported wearing an N95 respirator while treating or interacting with monkeypox patients. N95 respirator use by HCP varied among health care settings: 64% of exposures of HCP in community health and STI clinics, 50% in hospitals and emergency departments (EDs), and 12% in primary and urgent care settings occurred while the health care worker was wearing an N95 respirator (Figure). Among the 72 (23%) HCP who wore all recommended PPE while treating monkeypox patients, all were classified as low or uncertain risk. Adherence to all recommended PPE ranged from 4% in primary and urgent care settings to 48% in community health and STI clinics. Clinical staff members reported higher PPE use than did nonclinical staff members, with providers and nurses reporting the highest compliance with recommendations (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121197). 

HCP with intermediate- and high-risk exposures (87; 28%) were eligible to receive PEP with JYNNEOS vaccine (Table). Among eligible HCP, 37 (43%) received PEP, including 10 (50%) with high-risk exposures and 27 (40%) with intermediate-risk exposures. Seven of the 313 exposed HCP experienced symptoms during their 21-day monitoring period; three had rash or lesions, and four had other nonspecific symptoms. Two of the three HCP with rash or lesions were tested for Orthopoxvirus; both PCR test results were negative, and the third health care worker had an alternative diagnosis for their rash (medication reaction).","In the United States, data suggest that widespread community transmission of monkeypox has occurred in the context of sexual or close intimate contact (3). In Colorado, monkeypox transmission did not occur to 313 HCP with varying levels of exposure to patients with monkeypox during patient care or through contaminated materials. These findings are consistent with literature review from previous U.S. outbreaks (1) and internationally imported cases (4,5), with one case report of transmission to a health care worker after contact with contaminated patient linens in the United Kingdom during a previous outbreak (6), and one case of transmission to a health care worker in the United States during the current outbreak (7). Most HCP exposures in this analysis (72%) were classified as low or uncertain risk; only seven HCP (2%) were exposed during an aerosol-generating procedure. These data are consistent with evidence that occupationally acquired monkeypox is unlikely to occur when adhering to recommended infection prevention and control precautions. 

Only 23% of exposed HCP wore all recommended PPE. Although mask use was common, likely because of current COVID-19 source control recommendations, only 38% of HCP wore N95 respirators, and 64%, 40%, and 31% wore gloves, gowns, and eye protection, respectively. These low percentages might have been due to lack of awareness of 1) a patient’s symptoms before entering their care area, 2) community transmission, 3) monkeypox PPE recommendations, or 4) monkeypox signs and symptoms or atypical presentation (3). 

These data suggest that opportunities exist to improve awareness and training among frontline HCP who are most likely to see patients with monkeypox, so that they can take steps to protect themselves from exposure. The need for increased awareness and preparation was most apparent in primary care and urgent care settings where adherence to recommended PPE use was lowest. STI clinics became referral centers in Colorado, which might explain the higher PPE adherence in these settings. PPE use varied by job type as well, with more clinical providers and nursing staff members typically wearing recommended PPE than nonclinical staff members. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, higher compliance in community health and STI clinics might not be generalizable nationwide because these sites were used as referral centers in Colorado; these clinics were often informed of patients with suspected monkeypox before the patient arrived and were aware of current PPE and infection control recommendations. Second, PEP vaccination data were limited and might have been underreported. The Colorado Immunization Information System verification process was limited because of potential typographical errors in HCP names or dates of birth, as well as whether a health care worker consented to their information being entered into the system. Third, data on exposures to contaminated materials were incomplete, limiting the ability to draw conclusions regarding this potential route of transmission. Finally, information about whether patients had covered lesions or worn facemasks during their health care visits was unavailable. 

This study illustrated that the risk for HCP acquiring monkeypox after exposure to patients with monkeypox was very low despite incomplete adherence to recommended PPE, especially among primary and urgent care settings, and receipt of PEP by fewer than one half of eligible exposed HCP. Despite these gaps, no HCP in Colorado developed monkeypox during their 21-day monitoring period. These results underscore the importance of public health outreach to better understand the circumstances of HCP exposures so that prevention, infection prevention education, and training of HCP can be improved, especially in primary care and urgent care settings. In addition, these data might support future updates to PPE use recommendations and exposure risk classification in health care settings.","Corresponding author: Kristen E.

This case report highlights findings from the related epidemiologic investigation and describes the public health actions taken. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.* This is the youngest patient with confirmed monkeypox infection in Florida to date. 

The infant was initially evaluated in an emergency department (ED) for a raised erythematous rash on the arms, legs, and trunk which had been present for 5 days. A rash swab was collected for bacterial culture and yielded a negative test result. Varicella, herpes simplex virus, and HIV testing were also negative. The patient returned to the ED 2 days later, at which time the rash had progressed to include numerous, diffusely scattered papulovesicular lesions over the body, many with central umbilication. The infant was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum and started on intravenous antibiotics for secondary bacterial cellulitis associated with having scratched a lesion on the arm. The lesions subsequently spread to the back, soles of feet, face, and eyelid and became pustular over the first few days of admission. Swabs from forehead and back lesions tested positive for Orthopoxvirus DNA and Clade II Monkeypox virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction 10 days after rash onset (Figure). Results were confirmed by the Florida public health laboratory and CDC.† FDOH and hospital clinicians consulted with CDC regarding treatment options. The infant was treated with oral tecovirimat and Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (1). Prophylactic trifluridine§ drops were administered to prevent ophthalmic complications from the eyelid lesion. The infant remained afebrile and stable throughout the course of illness, tolerated the treatments well, and fully recovered. 

The infant had no history of travel, no history of acute infections in the 3 weeks preceding rash onset, no known immunocompromising conditions, did not attend a child care facility, and had no caregivers outside the home. Within the home, the infant was cared for by four caregivers. Caregiver A acted as the main guardian throughout the infant’s hospital stay and had prolonged exposure with skin-to-skin contact. Caregiver B reported activities that placed him at high risk for monkeypox exposure during the 2 months preceding the infant’s illness (2). Caregiver B reported hematuria and fever, followed by a rash within the 3 weeks before the infant’s symptom onset. One day before the infant became symptomatic, caregiver B moved to another state and sought medical care for his symptoms. He received a positive Orthopoxvirus DNA test result 2 days after the infant’s positive test result, after which, he was lost to follow-up. The infant had daily close contact with caregiver B in the home for 6 weeks before rash onset. Possible routes of transmission included shared bed linens and skin-to-skin contact through holding and daily care activities. Investigation identified three other household family members with household exposures to both the infant and caregiver B. Caregiver B, caregiver C, and the infant shared a bed for the 6 weeks preceding the infant’s symptom onset. All household members (caregivers A, B, C, and D) held the infant with close skin-to-skin contact. Caregivers A, C, and D received postexposure prophylaxis with JYNNEOS vaccine and remained asymptomatic at 22 days after the infant’s symptom onset (2,3). Caregiver A had also received smallpox vaccination during childhood. 

To date, 27 confirmed cases of monkeypox in pediatric patients aged 0–15 years have been reported in the United States during the 2022 outbreak (4). Clinical presentations in children with monkeypox have been similar to those in adults, although children might have a higher risk for severe disease (5). Timely laboratory identification and thorough epidemiologic investigation are critical for effective public health response to monkeypox infection. In this case, contact tracing and postexposure prophylaxis vaccination of close contacts of the affected infant might have prevented further transmission to household members (3). Clinicians should consider monkeypox infection as a differential diagnosis in pediatric patients with pustular or vesicular rashes and be aware of the possibility for household transmission to pediatric patients, particularly if the children meet epidemiologic exposure criteria for diagnosis of monkeypox (6).

Suicide is preventable. It disproportionately affects American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons. Previous studies have examined suicide characteristics and circumstances among non-Hispanic AI/AN only in a limited number of states. 

What is added by this report? 

Comparison of 2015–2020 suicides among all AI/AN and non-AI/AN decedents in 49 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia found that AI/AN suicide decedents had higher adjusted odds of a range of relationship and alcohol or other substance use problems, and reduced odds of known mental health conditions and treatment than did non-AI/AN suicide decedents. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Culturally relevant comprehensive public health approaches to suicide prevention are needed to address systemic and long-standing inequities among AI/AN persons.

Compared with the general U.S. population, American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons, particularly those who are not Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) AI/AN, are disproportionately affected by suicide; rates among this group consistently surpass those among all other racial and ethnic groups (1). Suicide rates among non-Hispanic AI/AN persons increased nearly 20% from 2015 (20.0 per 100,000) to 2020 (23.9), compared with a <1% increase among the overall U.S. population (13.3 and 13.5, respectively) (1). Understanding characteristics of suicide among AI/AN persons is critical to developing and implementing effective prevention strategies. A 2018 report described suicides in 18 states among non-Hispanic AI/AN persons only (2). The current study used 2015–2020 National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) data among 49 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to examine differences in suicide characteristics and contributing circumstances among Hispanic and non-Hispanic AI/AN populations, including multiracial AI/AN. Results indicated higher odds across a range of circumstances, including 10 of 14 relationship problems (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] range = 1.2–3.8; 95% CI range = 1.0–5.3) and six of seven substance use problems (aOR range = 1.2–2.3; 95% CI range = 1.1–2.5), compared with non-AI/AN persons. Conversely, AI/AN decedents had reduced odds of having any current known mental health condition, any history of mental health or substance use treatment, and other common risk factors (aOR range = 0.6–0.8; 95% CI = 0.2–0.9). Suicide is preventable. Communities can implement a comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention that addresses long-standing inequities affecting AI/AN populations (3). 

NVDRS is a state-based surveillance system that collects information from death certificates, coroner or medical examiner reports, and law enforcement reports on the characteristics and circumstances of violent deaths, including suicides (4). Data in this report are from the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 49 U.S. states participating in NVDRS during 2015–2020*; some jurisdictions did not participate for the entire period because they were not yet funded or because they did not achieve data completion thresholds (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121071) (4). Analyses were limited to decedents aged ≥10 years, because determining suicide intent in young children can be difficult (5). AI/AN persons are defined in NVDRS as persons with origins among any of the original peoples of North America and who maintain cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition (Alaska Natives are included among this group) (6). For this study, characteristics and circumstances of suicide were compared among decedents with any AI/AN identification, similar to a recent analysis of homicides among AI/AN persons (7). Rural-urban commuting area codes were used to determine nonmetropolitan and metropolitan geographic areas. All comparisons between AI/AN and non-AI/AN persons were examined using Pearson’s chi-square tests (with p<0.05 considered statistically significant) and logistic regression analyses, controlling for age and sex to estimate aORs with 95% CIs. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This analysis was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.† 

During 2015–2020, a total of 3,397 suicides among AI/AN persons and 179,850 suicides among non-AI/AN persons were recorded in NVDRS (Table 1). Approximately three quarters (74.6%) of AI/AN suicide decedents were aged ≤44 years, compared with less than one half (46.5%) of non-AI/AN decedents. The highest percentage of AI/AN suicides (46.9%) occurred among persons aged 25–44 years, whereas among non-AI/AN persons, the largest percentage (35%) occurred among persons aged 45–64 years. Nearly 45% of AI/AN suicide decedents (compared with 18.7% of non-AI/AN suicide decedents) lived in nonmetropolitan areas. AI/AN suicide decedents had higher odds of dying by hanging, strangulation, or suffocation (aOR = 1.8) and lower odds of dying from a firearm injury (aOR = 0.7) compared with non-AI/AN decedents. AI/AN suicide decedents also had higher odds of dying in a natural area (e.g., field; aOR = 1.4) or supervised facility (e.g., prison; aOR = 2.0) compared with non-AI/AN suicide decedents. 

The circumstances of suicide were known for 86% of AI/AN and 89% of non-AI/AN decedents (Table 2). AI/AN decedents were more likely than were non-AI/AN decedents to disclose suicidal intent before death (aOR = 1.2) and to have had previous suicidal thoughts or plans (aOR = 1.1), but they were less likely to leave a note (aOR = 0.7). Nearly 55% of AI/AN suicide decedents experienced any relationship problems or losses before their death, compared with 42.2% of non-AI/AN decedents (aOR = 1.4). AI/AN decedents had increased odds of an additional nine of 14 relationship problems, including higher odds of intimate partner problems (aOR = 1.4), family relationship problems (aOR = 1.2), other relationship problems (aOR=1.4), interpersonal violence victimization (aOR = 2.7) and perpetration (aOR = 1.6) within the preceding month, suicide of a friend or family member (aOR = 1.6), and arguments or conflicts preceding death (aOR = 1.6). Conversely, AI/AN suicide decedents had decreased odds of physical health, job, and financial problems than did non-AI/AN decedents (aOR range = 0.6–0.8). 

Approximately one third of AI/AN (31.8%) and non-AI/AN suicide decedents (29.7%) had experienced a crisis within the preceding 2 weeks or anticipated a crisis in the upcoming 2 weeks; AI/AN decedents had higher odds of having experienced crises involving intimate partners and recent suicide of friends or family members as well as crises involving criminal legal problems than did non-AI/AN decedents (aOR range = 1.2–3.8). In addition, AI/AN decedents had higher odds of six of seven alcohol or substance use problems including any current substance use problem (aOR = 2.0), a current alcohol (aOR = 2.3) or other substance use problem (aOR = 1.6), reported alcohol use hours before death (aOR = 1.9), and crises involving alcohol (aOR = 1.6). Among persons released from an institution within the month preceding death (196), 9.2% of AI/AN decedents had been in residential substance use treatment, compared with 5.5% of non-AI/AN decedents. The prevalences of known mental health diagnoses (41.5%; [aOR = 0.7]) and history of mental health or substance use treatment (29.5%; [aOR = 0.7]) were lower among AI/AN decedents than among non-AI/AN decedents (49.2% and 35.1%, respectively). 

Toxicology testing was performed for 66.6% of AI/AN suicide decedents and 61.1% of non-AI/AN decedents (Table 3). Overall, AI/AN decedents had higher odds than did non-AI/AN decedents of receiving a positive test result for at least one substance (aOR = 1.2), blood alcohol concentration of ≥0.08 g/dL (aOR = 2.3), amphetamines (aOR = 1.5), and marijuana (aOR = 1.5). Conversely, AI/AN decedents had lower odds than did non-AI/AN decedents of receiving a positive test result for opioids (aOR = 0.5), benzodiazepines (aOR = 0.4), cocaine (aOR = 0.5), antidepressants (aOR = 0.6), antipsychotics (aOR = 0.7), and barbiturates (aOR = 0.3).","Analyses of characteristics of and circumstances preceding suicide among AI/AN and non-AI/AN persons in participating NVDRS jurisdictions during 2015–2020 identified many differences, including higher odds of relationship and substance use problems and lower odds of physical, job, and financial problems; known mental health conditions; and any history of mental health or substance use treatment among AI/AN decedents compared with non-AI/AN decedents. Although direct comparison of circumstances between studies is not possible, these findings suggest a similar pattern observed in a previous analysis of suicide in 18 states among non-Hispanic AI/AN persons compared with non-Hispanic White populations, during 2003–2014 (2). Those findings also indicated higher odds of relationship and alcohol problems and reduced odds of known mental health problems, current or past mental health or substance use treatment, and physical, job, or financial problems. Toxicology results from the earlier study also followed the same pattern as those observed in the current study, including higher odds of positive alcohol, amphetamine, and marijuana toxicology results among AI/AN decedents, and reduced odds of positive opioid and antidepressant test results, compared with non-AI/AN decedents. 

The current study found higher odds of suicide among AI/AN persons across a range of relationship problems related to intimate partners, family, other relationships, interpersonal violence victimization and perpetration, and death of friends or family members by suicide. Similarly, more alcohol and other substance use circumstances, including those of an acute and more chronic nature, were observed in this study, as were criminal problems, although the nature of these problems was unknown. According to previous NVDRS reports, approximately one half of persons who die by suicide do not have a known mental health condition (4). This study found that only 41.5% of AI/AN suicide decedents had a known mental health condition. This might be the result of less available or accessible mental health services, especially in rural areas, and therefore fewer diagnoses. Post-hoc analyses controlling for metropolitan status did not change these results, suggesting possible contribution of other factors. 

Suicide prevention efforts among AI/AN populations must consider the context and consequences of current inequities as well as historical trauma, including intergenerational transmission, that continue to affect AI/AN persons, families, and communities today (8). Suicide is a complex problem with multiple contributing circumstances that affect different communities differently. A comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention (3), with attention to strategies that aim to reduce health inequities among AI/AN persons, is needed. These strategies might include strengthening access to and delivery of culturally relevant care, including telehealth for mental health concerns and well-being, increasing training and hiring of AI/AN providers, promoting community engagement and cultural traditions, increasing coping and problem-solving skills (e.g., American Indian Life Skills Training),§ increasing training to recognize and respond to suicide risk, making postvention programs (activities that reduce risk and promote healing after a suicide death) more available to AI/AN survivors of suicide loss (3), and promoting the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (persons who are thinking about suicide or who know someone who is thinking about suicide, should call 988).¶ 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, participation in NVDRS states increased during the analysis period; therefore, not all jurisdictions contributed data equally during all years. Second, deaths among AI/AN persons are prone to racial and ethnic misclassification, leading to potential underestimation of AI/AN suicides (9). However, the analysis included any decedent with noted AI/AN ancestry, including multiracial AI/AN, irrespective of Hispanic ethnicity, allowing for a more inclusive understanding of AI/AN suicide characteristics and circumstances. Third, NVDRS does not yet include tribal affiliation, and results might vary by tribe. Finally, circumstance data in NVDRS rely upon reporting by next-of-kin and other informants who knew the decedent, and their knowledge and willingness to share information about the decedent and circumstances preceding suicide. This might overestimate or underestimate this information. 

Prevention of suicide is possible (3). Identification of new evidence-based programs, evaluation of existing AI/AN programs, and tailoring of other effective programs to prevent suicide among AI/AN persons is needed. Programs can benefit from holistic indigenous evaluation, which takes into consideration AI/AN cultural values and practices, such as storytelling (10). Addressing AI/AN-specific risk and promoting the many protective factors among AI/AN persons can save lives.","Corresponding author: Deborah Stone, zaf9@cdc.gov, 770-488-3942.","Suggested citation for this article: Stone D, Trinh E, Zhou H, et al.

Currently, the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) are recommended for U.S. children, and the recommendations vary by age group and risk group.

What is added by this report?

On June 22, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended use of PCV15 as an option for pneumococcal conjugate vaccination of persons aged <19 years, according to currently recommended PCV13 dosing and schedules. Risk-based recommendations on use of PPSV23 have not changed.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Use of PCV15 as an alternative to PCV13 is expected to further reduce pneumococcal disease incidence in children and adolescents.

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc]) and the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23 [Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC]) have been recommended for U.S. children, and the recommendations vary by age group and risk group (1,2). In 2021, 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15 [Vaxneuvance, Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC]) was licensed for use in adults aged ≥18 years (3). On June 17, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an expanded usage for PCV15 to include persons aged 6 weeks–17 years, based on studies that compared antibody responses to PCV15 with those to PCV13 (4). PCV15 contains serotypes 22F and 33F (in addition to the PCV13 serotypes) conjugated to CRM197 (genetically detoxified diphtheria toxin). On June 22, 2022, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended use of PCV15 as an option for pneumococcal conjugate vaccination of persons aged <19 years according to currently recommended PCV13 dosing and schedules (1,2). ACIP employed the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework,* using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)† approach to guide its deliberations regarding use of these vaccines. Risk-based recommendations on use of PPSV23 for persons aged 2–18 years with certain underlying medical conditions§ that increase the risk for pneumococcal disease have not changed.

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7 [Prevnar, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]) was the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recommended for U.S. children in 2000 and was replaced by PCV13 in 2010. PCV13 was licensed by FDA based on safety and immunogenicity data compared with PCV7, and systematic reviews have shown that PCV13 is effective against acute otitis media, pneumonia, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children (5–7). PCV13 has been recommended for routine use among all children aged 2–59 months. In addition, risk-based use of PCV13 is recommended for children aged 60–71 months with certain underlying medical conditions that increase the risk for pneumococcal disease (hereafter, risk conditions), and for persons aged 6–18 years with an immunocompromising condition,¶ cerebrospinal fluid leak, or cochlear implant (a subset of risk conditions). PPSV23 is only recommended for persons aged 2–18 years with risk conditions.

During February–June 2022, ACIP reviewed the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease and considerations for use of PCV15 in children. The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group evaluated the quality of evidence for PCV15 immunogenicity and safety, using the GRADE approach. Applying the EtR Framework, the Work Group reviewed relevant scientific evidence regarding the benefits and harms of PCV15 use among children who are recommended to receive PCV13. Within the EtR framework, ACIP considered the importance of the public health problem, benefits and harms, the target population’s values and preferences, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility of PCV15 use. After a systematic review of the literature, the Work Group defined critical outcomes and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence rated on a scale of 1 (high certainty) to 4 (very low certainty).**

Evidence
Pneumococcal Disease Incidence in Persons Aged <19 Years
Acute otitis media is one of the most common diagnoses associated with outpatient pediatric medical visits (8) and antibiotic prescribing (9). According to a recent analysis using administrative data, 20,800 all-cause acute otitis media episodes per 100,000 person-years occurred among U.S. persons aged <18 years during 2018, with a higher incidence in younger age groups (10). During 2015–2019, in a cohort of 319 U.S. children aged 6–36 months with clinically diagnosed acute otitis media, Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected in the middle ear fluid of 24% (11); 9% of these children were infected with a PCV13 serotype (including 6C), and 8% with one of the serotypes included in PCV15 but not in PCV13 (serotypes 22F and 33F) (11). Additional analysis using administrative data estimated that among persons aged <18 years, 1,280 to 3,990 episodes of health care utilization per 100,000 person-years occurred in 2014 for all-cause pneumonia (12), and that during 2018–2019, 87 to 680 hospitalizations per 100,000 population occurred for all-cause pneumonia (13). Using population-based surveillance data, S. pneumoniae was detected in 4% of persons aged <18 years who were hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia; the attributable proportion of pneumococcus and serotype distribution among all-cause pneumonia in children and adolescents, however, has not been determined (14). According to U.S. multistate surveillance, the incidence of IPD†† during 2018–2019 was 7.2 per 100,000 children aged <5 years and 1.5 per 100,000 persons aged 5–18 years. PCV13-serotypes accounted for 21% and 34% of IPD cases in children aged <5 years and persons aged 5–18 years, respectively; similarly, additional serotypes unique to PCV15§§ caused 15% and 23% of IPD in children aged <5 years and persons aged 5–18 years, respectively (15).

PCV15 Immunogenicity
Phase II and III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the immunogenicity of PCV15 compared with PCV13 in healthy infants and children (16–19), persons aged 5–17 years with sickle cell disease (20), and persons aged 6–17 years living with HIV infection (21). The following outcomes were measured 30 days after administration of ≥1 doses of PCV, as specified in the respective study protocols: serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) geometric mean concentration (GMC) (16–21), proportion of participants meeting the serotype-specific IgG value of ≥0.35 μg/mL (response rate) (16–19), and opsonophagocytic activity geometric mean titer in a subset of the study population (17,20,21). One of the phase III RCTs enrolled healthy children aged 42–90 days who received PCV13 or PCV15 at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12–15 months. Except for serotype 6A GMC ratio after dose 3, PCV15 met criteria for noninferiority¶¶ to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes regarding the response rate after dose 3 and GMC ratio after dose 3 and after dose 4. PCV15 elicited statistically significantly higher immune response for serotype 3 than for PCV13 (17). PCV15 met the noninferiority criteria compared with PCV13 for the two unique serotypes 22F and 33F (17).

Another phase III RCT enrolled healthy children aged 42–90 days who were randomized to five different arms that received 0–4 doses of PCV15 in combination with PCV13 to complete their 4-dose PCV series, to assess interchangeable use of PCV13 and PCV15 (19). IgG GMCs for the 13 shared serotypes measured after dose 4 in children who received ≥1 dose of PCV15 were generally comparable to those in children who completed their PCV series with PCV13 only. Among PCV-naïve or partially vaccinated persons aged 7 months–17 years who received catch-up PCV doses, PCV15 elicited IgG GMCs comparable to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes (18). Among children with sickle cell disease, a dose of PCV15 elicited higher IgG GMC for six of 13 shared serotypes and for the two unique serotypes (20). Among children living with HIV infection, a dose of PCV15 elicited higher IgG GMC for eight of 13 shared serotypes and for the two unique serotypes, compared with a dose of PCV13; 1 dose of PCV15 followed by PPSV23 8 weeks later elicited higher IgG GMC for three of 13 shared serotypes compared with a dose of PCV13 followed by PPSV23, although IgG GMC for 22F and 33F were lower in those who received PCV15 followed by PPSV23 than in those who received PCV13 followed by PPSV23 (21).

PCV15 Safety
Safety of PCV15 was assessed in seven RCTs with 4,778 persons aged 6 weeks–17 years who received ≥1 dose of PCV15 (16–23). Two of these RCTs that enrolled children and adolescents with sickle cell disease or HIV infection were assessed separately. Of the remaining five studies that enrolled healthy children, four were also included in the immunogenicity assessment (16–19). Three studies included preterm infants born at <37 weeks gestation (17,19,23). Across these five studies, four of 4,540 children who received PCV15 developed serious adverse events*** that were considered to be vaccine-related, compared with one of 2,655 children who received PCV13. The two RCTs that enrolled children with sickle cell disease or HIV infection were both included in the immunogenicity assessment (20,21). No serious adverse events that were considered to be vaccine-related were reported in either study.

Given the similarities in the target population and the vaccine schedule used, a detailed safety assessment was performed combining data from three studies of healthy infants who received 4 doses of PCV15 (3,002) or PCV13 (1,467) at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12–15 months (17,19,22,23). The most commonly reported adverse events after any PCV dose included irritability (75.1% in the PCV15 group versus 72.7% in the PCV13 group), somnolence (56.7% versus 59.3%), injection site pain (45.1% versus.43.5%), and decreased appetite (39.1% versus 36.0%). Febrile convulsions were reported in eight of 3,002 (0.3%) children who received PCV15, and three of 1,467 (0.2%) who received PCV13. Nearly all (8 of 11, 73%) febrile convulsions occurred ≥50 days after PCV receipt, and none were deemed vaccine-related by study investigators. Adverse events that were considered to be vaccine-related were reported in 89.1% of children who received PCV15 and 86.4% of those in the PCV13 group. Two children (0.1%) who received PCV15 and none who received PCV13 had serious adverse events that were considered to be vaccine-related; both of these children were hospitalized for fever after vaccine administration (after dose 1 and after dose 3). A maximum rectal (or rectal equivalent) temperature of ≥104°F (40°C) within the first 7 days after vaccination was reported for 19 of 2,772 (0.7%) children who received a fourth dose of PCV15 and three of 1,287 (0.2%) who received PCV13.

Cost-Effectiveness
Two economic models (CDC model and Merck model) that assessed cost-effectiveness compared the use of PCV15 and PCV13 according to the currently recommended PCV13 4-dose series for children aged <2 years (24). PCV15 and PCV13 were assumed to have the same vaccine effectiveness against disease caused by the 13 serotypes contained in PCV13. For PCV15, the effectiveness against the two additional serotypes was assumed to be comparable to the overall effectiveness against disease caused by the serotypes contained in PCV13. In the CDC model, PCV15 effectiveness against IPD caused by the two additional serotypes was assumed to be 86% and the effectiveness against IPD caused by most of the other serotypes (excluding serotype 3 and 19F) was assumed to be 86%. Effectiveness against serotypes 3 and 19F disease was assumed to be lower than that against the other PCV serotypes (25). In the Merck model, PCV15 effectiveness against IPD caused by the two additional serotypes was assumed to be 86% and the effectiveness against the other serotypes was assumed to range from 80% to 100%. In both models, using PCV15 instead of PCV13 for routine vaccination of children was cost-saving††† in all scenarios examined, including scenarios in which the PCV15 cost per dose§§§ ranged from $4 less to $2 more than the PCV13 cost per dose.


Summary
PCV15 as an option for pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is expected to reduce pneumococcal disease incidence in children because it induces immunity against additional disease-causing serotypes. Findings from RCTs suggested that the immunogenicity and safety of PCV15 are generally comparable to those of PCV13. Cost-effectiveness studies demonstrated that routine use of PCV15 for children aged <2 years was cost-saving, assuming that the cost and effectiveness of PCV15 for the 13 shared serotypes will remain comparable to those of PCV13 and that PCV15 will provide protection against the two additional serotypes. A summary of Work Group deliberations on use of PCV15 as an option for pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is available in the EtR tables.¶¶¶


Recommendations for Use of PCV
ACIP recommends use of PCV (either PCV13 or PCV15) for all children aged 2–59 months. In addition, risk-based PCV use is recommended for children aged 60–71 months with risk conditions, and persons aged 6–18 years with an immunocompromising condition, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or cochlear implant. For all recommendations, PCV13 and PCV15 can be used interchangeably. Interruption of the vaccination schedule does not require reinstitution of the entire series or the addition of extra doses.

Persons Aged <19 Years with No Previous PCV13 or PCV15 Vaccination
Infants aged 2–6 months. Four doses of PCV (either PCV13 or PCV15) are recommended. The primary infant series consists of 3 doses of PCV. Infants receiving their first dose at age ≤6 months should receive 3 doses of PCV at intervals of approximately 8 weeks (with a minimum interval of 4 weeks). The fourth (booster) dose is recommended at age 12–15 months and ≥8 weeks after the third dose (Table 1).

Infants should begin the schedule at age 2 months, although the first dose can be administered as early as 6 weeks. For prematurely born infants (i.e., <37 weeks’ gestation) who are medically stable enough to be vaccinated (26), PCV should be administered at the recommended age concurrent with other routine vaccinations.

Infants aged 7–11 months. When PCV is initiated at age 7–11 months, 3 doses (either PCV13 or PCV15) are recommended. The first 2 doses should be administered with an interval of ≥4 weeks between doses. The third dose should be administered at age 12–15 months, ≥8 weeks after the second PCV dose.

Children aged 12–23 months. When PCV is initiated at 12–23 months of age, 2 doses (either PCV13 or PCV15) are recommended, with an interval of ≥8 weeks between doses.

Children aged 24–71 months. Unvaccinated healthy children aged 24–59 months should receive a single dose of PCV (either PCV13 or PCV15). Unvaccinated children aged 24–71 months with any risk condition should receive 2 doses of PCV (either PCV13 or PCV15) with an interval of ≥8 weeks between doses. Routine use of PCV is not recommended for healthy children aged ≥5 years who have not yet received a dose of PCV.

Children and adolescents aged 6–18 years with an immunocompromising condition, cochlear implant, or cerebrospinal fluid leak. If a dose of PCV13 or PCV15 has not been administered previously, a single dose of PCV13 or PCV15 is recommended, regardless of whether the child has previously received PPSV23, even if PCV7 was received.

Persons Aged <19 Years Vaccinated Previously with PCV13 or PCV15
Infants and children aged <24 months. Infants and children aged <24 months who have received ≥1 dose of PCV (either PCV13 or PCV15) should complete the vaccination series with either PCV13 or PCV15 (Table 2).

Children aged 24–71 months. For all healthy children aged 24–59 months with any incomplete PCV schedule as of age 24 months, 1 additional dose of PCV is recommended. For children aged 24–71 months with any risk conditions who have received any incomplete schedule of <3 PCV doses**** before age 24 months, 2 additional PCV doses of PCV are recommended. Children aged 24–71 months with any risk conditions who have received their 3-dose PCV primary series before age 12 months but have not received their fourth booster dose, are recommended to receive a single additional PCV dose. The minimum interval between doses is 8 weeks.

Complete PCV13 vaccination. A supplemental dose of PCV15 is not indicated for children who have received 4 doses of PCV13 or who completed another age-appropriate PCV13 schedule.

Administration of PPSV23 After PCV13 or PCV15 Among Persons Aged 2–18 Years with Risk Conditions
Children aged ≥2 years with any risk conditions should receive PPSV23 after completing all recommended PCV doses (either PCV13 or PCV15). These children should receive a single dose of PPSV23 at age ≥2 years and ≥8 weeks after the most recent PCV dose (Table 3). Children who have received PPSV23 but have not yet completed their recommended PCV doses should receive PCV ≥8 weeks after the PPSV23 dose. When elective splenectomy, immunocompromising therapy, or cochlear implant placement is being planned, PCV or PPSV23 vaccination should be completed ≥2 weeks before surgery or initiation of therapy, if possible.

Revaccination with PPSV23 among children with immunocompromising conditions. Children aged ≥2 years who have an immunocompromising condition should receive a second dose of PPSV23 ≥5 years after the first PPSV23 dose.

Recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants are recommended to receive 3 sequential PCV doses followed by a dose of PPSV23 beginning 3–6 months after the transplant, as described in the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization (27). In children with graft-versus-host disease, PPSV23 can be replaced with a fourth dose of PCV.

Vaccine Administration
PCV13 and PCV15 are both available in a single-dose prefilled syringe as a 0.5-mL dose administered intramuscularly. Either PCV13 or PCV15 can be administered at the same time as other routine childhood vaccinations, including COVID-19 vaccines (28), in separate syringes and using different injection sites. Concurrent PCV15 administration with vaccines containing diphtheria; tetanus; acellular pertussis; inactivated poliovirus; Haemophilus influenzae type b; hepatitis A; hepatitis B; measles, mumps, and rubella; rotavirus; and varicella were studied (17,19). Immunogenicity of these antigens was similar when administered concurrently with PCV15 and PCV13 (17,19). Coadministration of PCV15 with meningococcal vaccines has not been studied. The same precautions used for coadministration of PCV13 and meningococcal vaccines should be applied when PCV15 is used (29). Risk for febrile seizures in children who received PCV15 concurrently with an influenza vaccine has not been studied.


Reporting of Adverse Events
Before administering PCV or PPSV23, health care providers should consult relevant package inserts regarding precautions and contraindications (30–32). Adverse events occurring after administration of any vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Reports can be submitted to VAERS online, by fax, or by mail. More information about VAERS is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov.

Future Research and Monitoring Priorities
CDC and ACIP will continue to assess safety of PCV15; monitor the impact of implementation of new recommendations, including the impact on health equity; and assess postimplementation vaccine effectiveness. CDC and ACIP will update pneumococcal vaccination recommendations as appropriate.

Risk for severe COVID-19 increases with age, disability, and underlying medical conditions. The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is more infectious but has been associated with less severe disease. 

What is added by this report? 

In-hospital mortality among patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 decreased from 15.1% (Delta period) to 4.9% (later Omicron period; April–June 2022), despite high-risk patient groups representing a larger proportion of hospitalizations. During the later Omicron period, the majority of in-hospital deaths occurred among adults aged ≥65 years (81.9%) and persons with three or more underlying medical conditions (73.4%). 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Vaccination, early treatment, and appropriate nonpharmaceutical interventions remain important public health priorities to prevent COVID-19 deaths, especially among persons most at risk.

The risk for COVID-19–associated mortality increases with age, disability, and underlying medical conditions (1). Early in the emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was lower than that during previous pandemic peaks (2–5), and some health authorities reported that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 hospitalizations were not primarily for COVID-19–related illness,* which might account for the lower mortality among hospitalized patients. Using a large hospital administrative database, CDC assessed in-hospital mortality risk overall and by demographic and clinical characteristics during the Delta (July–October 2021), early Omicron (January–March 2022), and later Omicron (April–June 2022) variant periods† among patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19. Model-estimated adjusted mortality risk differences (aMRDs) (measures of absolute risk) and adjusted mortality risk ratios (aMRRs) (measures of relative risk) for in-hospital death were calculated comparing the early and later Omicron periods with the Delta period. Crude mortality risk (cMR) (deaths per 100 patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19) was lower during the early Omicron (13.1) and later Omicron (4.9) periods than during the Delta (15.1) period (p<0.001). Adjusted mortality risk was lower during the Omicron periods than during the Delta period for patients aged ≥18 years, males and females, all racial and ethnic groups, persons with and without disabilities, and those with one or more underlying medical conditions, as indicated by significant aMRDs and aMRRs (p<0.05). During the later Omicron period, 81.9% of in-hospital deaths occurred among adults aged ≥65 years and 73.4% occurred among persons with three or more underlying medical conditions. Vaccination, early treatment, and appropriate nonpharmaceutical interventions remain important public health priorities for preventing COVID-19 deaths, especially among persons most at risk. 

COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths during April 2020–June 2022 were identified from 678 hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR).§ COVID-19 hospitalizations were defined as those with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified [laboratory-confirmed]) listed as the primary or secondary discharge diagnosis; a COVID-19 in-hospital death was defined as a COVID-19 hospitalization with expired discharge status. COVID-19 hospitalizations were identified as being primarily for COVID-19 if they had 1) a U07.1 primary discharge diagnosis or 2) a U07.1 secondary discharge diagnosis accompanied by either treatment with remdesivir or a primary discharge diagnosis of sepsis, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory failure, or pneumonia.¶ Monthly cMRs (deaths per 100 hospitalizations) were calculated for COVID-19 hospitalizations (total, primarily for COVID-19, and not primarily for COVID-19) and non–COVID-19 hospitalizations. 

Patient-level analyses were conducted by selecting each patient’s last hospitalization primarily for COVID-19 during the Delta, early Omicron, and later Omicron periods. For each period, sociodemographic (age, sex, race and ethnicity, and insurance type), clinical (underlying medical conditions, disability status, and previous COVID-19),** disease severity (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, receipt of COVID-19 medications, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV]),†† and hospital (U.S. Census Bureau region and number of beds) characteristics were described for patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 and in-hospital deaths, and cMR was calculated. Descriptive analyses were also conducted for three pre-Delta periods (April–September 2020, October 2020–February 2021, and March–June 2021). 

Using a generalized estimating equations model, specified as a log-linked binomial regression including all three periods, aMRDs and aMRRs for in-hospital death were estimated across periods (early Omicron versus Delta and later Omicron versus Delta).§§ aMRDs were estimated as the difference in the adjusted predicted mortality risk between periods; aMRRs were estimated as the ratio of adjusted predicted mortality risk between periods.¶¶ SEs and 95% CIs were obtained by hospital-patient clustered bootstrapping with 500 replications. Z-tests were used to compare cMR, aMRDs, and aMRRs among pandemic periods; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and Stata (version 15.1; StataCorp). This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*** 

During April 2020–June 2022, a total of 1,072,106 COVID-19 hospitalizations and 128,517 in-hospital deaths were reported in PHD-SR. The proportion of COVID-19 hospitalizations identified as primarily for COVID-19 was relatively stable during the pre-Omicron period (83.8%, 95% CI = 83.7–83.9) and decreased during the Omicron period (62.8%, 95% CI = 62.6–63.0) (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121070). cMR was 1–2 percentage points higher for hospitalizations primarily for COVID-19 than for total COVID-19 hospitalizations through December 2021; the cMR difference increased to 3–3.5 percentage points during the early Omicron period, when the proportion of hospitalizations primarily for COVID-19 and cMRs began decreasing, and returned to 1–2 percentage points in the later Omicron period (Figure). 

Among patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 who died in-hospital during the Delta, early Omicron, and later Omicron periods, 57.8%, 58.0%, and 51.4%, respectively, were male; 63.8%, 66.8%, and 69.1%, respectively, were non-Hispanic White (White); 53.7%, 73.5%, and 81.9%, respectively, were aged ≥65 years; 15.1%, 22.9%, and 28.9%, respectively, had a disability; and 61.7%, 70.8%, and 73.4%, respectively, had three or more underlying medical conditions (Table 1). In addition, a decreasing proportion of patients who died in-hospital had other indicators of disease severity during the Delta, early Omicron, and later Omicron periods: 76.1%, 64.0%, and 57.2%, respectively, were admitted to ICU; 93.8%, 86.8%, and 76.4%, respectively, received COVID-19 medications; 61.8%, 51.2%, and 35.0%, respectively, received noninvasive ventilation; and 71.9%, 57.6%, and 43.6%, respectively, received IMV. 

The cMR among patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 was 15.1 during the Delta, 13.1 during the early Omicron, and 4.9 during the later Omicron periods (Table 2); cMR range was 9.9–16.1 during the pre-Delta periods (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121069). After adjustment, in-hospital mortality was 0.69 (95% CI = 0.68–0.70) times as likely during the early Omicron period and 0.24 (95% CI = 0.22–0.25) times as likely during the later Omicron period than during the Delta period. Adjusted mortality risk during the early and later Omicron periods was lower than it was during the Delta period for patients aged ≥18 years, males and females, all racial and ethnic groups, persons with and without disabilities, and those with one or more underlying medical conditions, as indicated by significant aMRDs and aMRRs (p<0.05); mortality risk did not differ between the Omicron and Delta periods for patients aged <18 years. Larger aMRDs were observed with increasing age and number of underlying medical conditions; aMRD and aMRR were similar in magnitude for patients with and without disabilities.","During the period of Omicron variant predominance, the crude mortality risk among patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 decreased to 4.9% during April–June 2022, which is lower than any previous time in the pandemic and approximately one third of what it was during the period of Delta variant predominance††† (5). In-hospital mortality decreased for all patient groups during the Omicron period and a larger proportion of hospitalizations and deaths occurred among populations most at risk for severe disease: patients aged ≥65 years and those with a disability or with three or more underlying medical conditions.§§§ Thus, in the later Omicron period, COVID-19 patients at lower risk were hospitalized less often and hospitalized COVID-19 patients at higher risk experienced less severe disease and lower mortality. 

Several factors likely contributed to these favorable outcomes during the Omicron period, including higher levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity (6), advances in early treatment for patients at risk for severe disease,¶¶¶ and lower pathogenicity of Omicron subvariants (7). COVID-19 primary series and booster vaccination coverage was higher during the Omicron period than during the Delta period****; the effectiveness of receipt of 2 or 3 doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines against severe illness and death among hospitalized patients was 89% during the Delta period and 86% during the early Omicron period (8). In addition, the proportion of the U.S. population with infection-induced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 increased from 33% in December 2021 to 57% by February 2022, indicating much higher infection-induced protection during the later Omicron period (9). Although oral COVID-19 antiviral therapies became available during the early Omicron period, their use increased substantially during the later Omicron period (10). These factors also likely contributed to reductions in other measures of disease severity observed during the later Omicron period, such as ICU admission and IMV. 

Hospitalizations not primarily for COVID-19 were excluded from this study to allow for temporal comparison of mortality risk among persons hospitalized with COVID-19–related illness. The estimate derived from this study for hospitalizations not primarily for COVID-19 (37%) during January–March 2022 is within the range (12%–48%) reported by other sources derived from heterogeneous definitions and populations†††† (5). Of note, the observed difference in crude mortality risk between the early Omicron and Delta periods among hospitalizations primarily for COVID-19 was substantially less than the difference among total COVID-19 hospitalizations in this study and in a previous study (2). Thus, variation in the proportion of hospitalizations primarily for COVID-19 should be considered when interpreting past and future studies that compare hospitalization outcomes across pandemic periods. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the definition of hospitalizations primarily for COVID-19 might be subject to misclassification, which could vary over time with changing patient and contextual factors. Second, COVID-19 vaccination status and previous COVID-19 are both under ascertained in PHD-SR; thus, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 immunity on mortality risk was not assessed. Third, disability status and number of underlying medical conditions might be misclassified because of reliance on ICD-10-CM codes. Fourth, PHD-SR data are incomplete for the later Omicron period; however, effect on mortality risk is expected to be minimal. Finally, although PHD-SR captures approximately 25% of annual U.S. hospital admissions, these findings might not be nationally generalizable. 

In-hospital mortality risk was substantially lower during the later Omicron period overall and for older adults, persons with disabilities, and persons with multiple underlying medical conditions, who accounted for a larger proportion of hospitalizations in this period than they did during previous periods and remained at highest risk for death. It is uncertain whether patients with multiple underlying medical conditions are being hospitalized for respiratory complications from COVID-19 or for other acute or chronic conditions potentially exacerbated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19–related hospitalizations and mortality should continue to be monitored as protective immunity evolves and new SARS-CoV-2 variants arise to inform public health guidance. Vaccination, early treatment, and appropriate nonpharmaceutical interventions remain important public health priorities to prevent severe COVID-19 illness and death, especially among persons most at risk (1).

Tecovirimat (Tpoxx) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of smallpox based on data obtained from animal models; there are no safety or efficacy data regarding its use in patients with Monkeypox virus infection. 

What is added by this report? 

Among 549 patients with Monkeypox virus infection treated with tecovirimat under an Expanded Access Investigational New Drug protocol, 99.8% received it orally as an outpatient. Among 369 patients, few adverse events were reported. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Tecovirimat is generally well tolerated, and these data support continued access to treatment with tecovirimat during the current monkeypox outbreak.

Currently, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved treatments for human monkeypox are available. Tecovirimat (Tpoxx), however, is an antiviral drug that has demonstrated efficacy in animal studies and is FDA-approved for treating smallpox. Use of tecovirimat for treatment of monkeypox in the United States is permitted only through an FDA-regulated Expanded Access Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) mechanism. CDC holds a nonresearch EA-IND protocol that facilitates access to and use of tecovirimat for treatment of monkeypox.§ The protocol includes patient treatment and adverse event reporting forms to monitor safety and ensure intended clinical use in accordance with FDA EA-IND requirements. The current multinational monkeypox outbreak, first detected in a country where Monkeypox virus infection is not endemic in May 2022, has predominantly affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (1,2). To describe characteristics of persons treated with tecovirimat for Monkeypox virus infection, demographic and clinical data abstracted from available tecovirimat EA-IND treatment forms were analyzed. As of August 20, 2022, intake and outcome forms were available for 549 and 369 patients, respectively; 97.7% of patients were men, with a median age of 36.5 years. Among patients with available data, 38.8% were reported to be non-Hispanic White (White) persons, 99.8% were prescribed oral tecovirimat, and 93.1% were not hospitalized. Approximately one half of patients with Monkeypox virus infection who received tecovirimat were living with HIV infection. The median interval from initiation of tecovirimat to subjective improvement was 3 days and did not differ by HIV infection status. Adverse events were reported in 3.5% of patients; all but one adverse event were nonserious. These data support the continued access to and treatment with tecovirimat for patients with or at risk for severe disease in the ongoing monkeypox outbreak. 

Tecovirimat¶ is an antiviral drug developed as a medical countermeasure to treat smallpox, a serious and life-threatening infection caused by Variola virus, of genus Orthopoxvirus; Monkeypox virus belongs to the same genus but typically causes less severe disease.** Global eradication of smallpox was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980.†† Because opportunities to develop clinical trials in countries where Monkeypox virus infection is considered endemic have been limited, the efficacy of tecovirimat to treat monkeypox has not been fully evaluated in humans. Instead, efficacy data that supported FDA approval of tecovirimat for smallpox were based on nonhuman primate and rabbit studies§§ (3); efficacy studies were also conducted in macaque monkeys and prairie dogs (4,5). 

During May 2022, a multinational monkeypox virus outbreak (Clade II) was first reported, principally affecting MSM (1,2). Interim CDC guidance currently recommends that tecovirimat be considered in patients with severe disease, those at high risk for severe disease, or those with aberrant infections.¶¶ This report describes the available demographic and clinical characteristics, clinical indications for use, clinical outcomes, and adverse events reported among some of the first known recipients of tecovirimat treatment under the EA-IND protocol for Monkeypox virus infection in the United States. 

During May 29–July 20, 2022, the EA-IND protocol required patient assessment forms at the start of treatment and once during three follow-up time points (assessment A: day 1–7, assessment B: day 8–14, and assessment C: posttreatment). Initially, the protocol’s eligibility criteria included laboratory confirmation of Monkeypox virus or Orthopoxvirus infection, or a presumptive diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms. The revised EA-IND protocol (version 6, dated July 20, 2022) was amended as follows: 1) a patient may be eligible for tecovirimat based on clinical signs and symptoms and if there was an epidemiologic link to a case of or exposure to Monkeypox virus, 2) the number of follow-up visits was reduced to one during and one posttreatment, and 3) only reporting of serious adverse events using MedWatch forms was required.*** Data abstracted from patient intake forms included demographic characteristics, orthopoxvirus vaccination status, immune status,††† laboratory test result, clinical signs and symptoms, reason for tecovirimat administration (i.e., lesions in sensitive anatomic areas, at risk for severe disease, and pain), formulation at the start of treatment (i.e., intravenous or oral), and number of days from symptom onset to administration of the first dose. Data from clinical outcome forms included whether the patient was hospitalized, number of days from initiation of treatment to subjective improvement, recovery status (i.e., recovered with or without sequelae or not yet recovered), and adverse events during and after treatment. The EA-IND protocol was reviewed and approved by CDC’s Institutional Review Board, reviewed and authorized by FDA, and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§ Analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Difference in time to subjective improvement between HIV-positive and patients without HIV-positive status documented were compared using a 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 

CDC abstracted data from patient intake forms for 549 persons with confirmed or suspected monkeypox who were prescribed tecovirimat therapy by August 20, 2022, and outcome forms for 369 patients. Data from both intake and outcome forms were available for 174 of these patients. Among 527 patients with intake forms and available data, 515 (97.7%) were male (Table 1). The median age was 36.5 years (IQR = 31.4–43.9 years). Among 464 patients with race and ethnicity data, 180 (38.8%) were White persons, 161 (34.7%) were Hispanic or Latino persons, and 83 (17.9%) were non-Hispanic Black or African American persons. Among 359 patients with available data, approximately two thirds (232, 64.6%) of tecovirimat recipients had lesions affecting <10% of their body; 17 (4.7%) had lesions affecting 75%–100% of their body. Among 529 patients with available data on number of lesions, 299 (56.5%) reported 10–100 lesions at the start of tecovirimat; 210 (39.7%) had fewer than 10 lesions, and 20 (3.8%) had more than 100 lesions. The presence of lesions in anatomic areas that might result in serious sequelae was reported on 191 (79.6%) of the 240 revised intake forms with available data. The most frequently reported underlying medical condition affecting immune status was HIV infection (254, 46.3%); viral load and CD4 count were not reported. Among 495 persons with available data on route of administration, the oral formulation of tecovirimat was prescribed to 494 (99.8%) at the start of therapy. Median interval from symptom onset to receipt of first tecovirimat dose was 7 days (IQR = 5–10 days) (Figure). Among 260 persons with revised intake forms, 124 (47.7%) had laboratory-confirmed Orthopoxvirus infection when tecovirimat treatment commenced. 

Among 369 patients with outcome forms, data on hospitalization status was available for 331; among these, 23 (6.9%) were hospitalized after symptom onset (Table 2), and the median duration of hospitalization was 4 days (IQR = 1–5 days). Among 255 patients with available data, the median time to subjective improvement after starting treatment was 3 days (IQR = 2–4 days).¶¶¶ Among 317 patients with available outcome information, 230 (72.6%) recovered with or without sequelae**** by or before completion of the posttreatment assessment; 87 (27.4%) patients were reported by clinicians to be not yet recovered, 78 of whom had not yet completed the standard 14-day tecovirimat treatment course. Adverse events were reported for 12 (3.5%) of 340 patients with information on adverse events; these included headache (three), nausea (two), visual disturbance (two), weakness (two), and hospitalization for psychiatric reasons (one).†††† At the time of the posttreatment follow-up visit, three (2.2%) of 137 persons with information available had developed new lesions compared with 25 (13.1%) who had developed new lesions during the first week of treatment. Most (119, 89.5%) patients reported that all lesions were crusted and healing with a new layer of skin under the scab following treatment. Among 174 patients with available data, the interval to subjective improvement did not differ between HIV-positive persons (42; median = 3 days) and persons without documentation of HIV positive status (64; median = 3 days) with available data (p = 0.83). 

","The data in this report support the continued availability of tecovirimat in the current monkeypox outbreak for U.S. patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically diagnosed monkeypox. Initial findings indicate that tecovirimat is likely well tolerated; among reported adverse events, most were not serious, and it is not known whether tecovirimat caused the adverse events reported. The preliminary safety reporting with tecovirimat use under the EA-IND is consistent with data from the healthy human tecovirimat safety studies (SIGA-246–001).§§§§ Two other investigational treatments for orthopoxviruses, cidofovir and brincidofovir, have demonstrated substantial toxicity with limited efficacy data (6). 

For patients treated under the EA-IND protocol and included in this report, the median time to subjective improvement was 3 days after receiving tecovirimat. However, no control group was available for comparison; therefore, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of tecovirimat to treat monkeypox based on these data. Time to improvement did not differ significantly with HIV infection status. A report from Nigeria suggested that HIV-positive patients might have prolonged illness; however, illness severity could be affected by HIV viral suppression, which was not reported in the current evaluation (7). Three of 137 patients (2.2%) with posttreatment follow-up and available data developed new lesions after completing treatment. A retrospective study in the United Kingdom reported one patient treated with tecovirimat had a shorter duration of illness compared with six patients (8), and another report of a small U.S. cohort treated with tecovirimat (also under the EA-IND) demonstrated complete resolution of lesions by day 21 in 23 (92%) of 25 patients (9). 

This report illustrated that many patients were prescribed tecovirimat for lesions in anatomic areas that might result in serious sequelae, and nearly all received tecovirimat as outpatients, suggesting that severe disease was uncommon. The demographic characteristics of patients who received tecovirimat are similar to those with monkeypox: as described recently by CDC: the first 3,000 reported monkeypox infections in the United States occurred almost exclusively (99%) in men, with a median age of 35 years; approximately 40% were in White persons; and 41% of patients were living with HIV infection (1). Approximately one half of patients described in the EA-IND data did not have laboratory confirmation of Monkeypox virus infection and received tecovirimat empirically; because it is currently not known which patients benefit most from tecovirimat treatment, clinical judgment is important. Although this report could not evaluate efficacy, clinicians are encouraged to continue following CDC guidelines for tecovirimat use in patients with severe disease or at risk for severe disease. Because there is the potential for false-positive test results, tecovirimat should be considered only in those with a high pretest probability of being infected with Monkeypox virus to avoid unnecessary treatment or implementation of other public health measures (10). Inappropriate uses could potentially lead to resistance (3). Continued prescribing guidance updates on administering tecovirimat to those who would benefit the most from its use will be crucial as more is learned about effectiveness, viral resistance, and adverse events. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, only patients whose EA-IND forms were submitted to CDC were included in this report, representing a fraction of those treated to date¶¶¶¶; this limitation could lead to convenience sample bias that might not be representative of all patients treated with tecovirimat. Second, to lessen the regulatory burden on prescribers, the EA-IND forms were streamlined during the data collection process, leading to inconsistent variable collection. Third, some variables were collected as free text; therefore, absent data might not necessarily indicate absence of conditions. Fourth, the profile of patients might differ across assessment time points; for example, those with worse initial symptoms might have been more likely to receive follow-up assessments, making true time to resolution or improvement difficult to ascertain. Fifth, it is not known whether the outcomes described for patients who received tecovirimat differ from those of patients who do not receive tecovirimat because no control group was included. Finally, CD4 count and viral load, markers of unsuppressed HIV infection, were not collected, limiting the evaluation of treatment outcomes for persons living with HIV infection. 

Ongoing monitoring is essential to assess the safety of tecovirimat in patients with Monkeypox virus infection under the EA-IND during the current monkeypox outbreak. CDC is continuing to review additional data as they become available. Currently, there are no human data demonstrating the efficacy of tecovirimat, and clinical trials are necessary to elucidate clinical efficacy in patients with Monkeypox virus infection, indications for treatment, and ideal duration of treatment.

Surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and wastewater (environmental) are critical to polio eradication efforts. Children with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) can excrete vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), which can hamper eradication efforts. 

What is added by this report? 

In March 2022, a type 3 VDPV was detected in stool specimens from an infant with PID who was hospitalized in Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China. Surveillance for poliovirus in PID patients has increased detection of immunodeficiency-related (iVDPV) cases. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Integrated systematic poliovirus surveillance, including AFP, environmental, and iVDPV surveillance, is critical to the detection and containment of all polioviruses and achievement of global polio eradication.

Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has proven to be highly effective in the global effort to eradicate poliomyelitis because of its ability to induce both humoral and intestinal immunity, ease of administration, and low cost (1). Sabin-strain OPV contains live attenuated virus and induces immunity by replicating in the intestinal tract, triggering an immune response that clears the vaccine virus. However, among undervaccinated communities and persons with immunodeficiency, OPV mutations that arise during prolonged replication can result in the emergence of genetically divergent, neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). In addition, OPV has resulted in rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) among vaccine recipients or their close contacts (1). Identification of circulating polioviruses relies on surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance of wastewater (i.e., sewage). In 2022, type 3 VDPV (VDPV3) was detected in stool specimens from an infant with primary immunodeficiency disorder (PID) through a pilot surveillance program to identify VDPVs in children with PIDs. Integrated AFP, environmental, and immunodeficiency-associated VDPV (iVDPV) surveillance is critical to detecting and containing all polioviruses and achieving the goal of global polio eradication. 

In 2016, the year after the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) Global Certification Commission* certified the eradication of type 2 wild poliovirus (WPV2) (2), China joined a global, synchronized effort to cease the use of type 2 oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV2). At that time, the routine polio vaccination schedule was changed from 3 doses of trivalent OPV (which contains Sabin strain types 1, 2 and 3) to 1 dose of injectable inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) (which contains inactivated 1, 2, and 3 poliovirus serotypes) followed by 3 doses of bivalent OPV (bOPV) (which contains Sabin strain types 1 and 3). In 2020, the schedule was changed to 2 doses of IPV followed by 2 doses of bOPV to increase protection against type 2 poliovirus. 

Although China was declared free of all indigenous wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission by the GPEI’s Regional Certification Commission in 2000,† the country continues to face two substantial threats to its polio-free status, namely the risk for importation of WPV from a country with endemic transmission and the emergence of circulating VDPVs because of ongoing domestic use of OPV. Sensitive, nationwide AFP surveillance§ is effective in detecting children paralyzed by WPVs and VDPVs. The National Polio Laboratory Network of China supports environmental surveillance to detect polioviruses excreted from infected persons or circulating in a community, even if not detected by AFP surveillance. 

Prolonged excretion of iVDPVs can potentially seed community transmission of genetically divergent infectious polioviruses, threatening polio eradication efforts. Children with PIDs are susceptible to recurrent, severe enterovirus infections. Because their immune systems cannot clear replicating live vaccine virus, these children are at increased risk for paralysis when exposed to OPV (3). Sensitive AFP surveillance detects iVDPV–infected persons with paralysis; however, persons who excrete iVDPV might not develop paralysis in the short-term, (4) and wastewater analysis in China is geographically limited in scope because not all areas of the country conduct environmental surveillance. These limitations of poliovirus surveillance mean that a substantial number of iVDPVs cases might not be routinely detected. 

In response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to extend poliovirus surveillance to persons with PIDs, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) launched a pilot iVDPV surveillance program in 2021. Five children’s hospitals located in Beijing, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and Chongqing participate in the program, which recruits children who receive a new diagnosis of primary antibody deficiency or combined immunodeficiency disorder to provide stool specimens for poliovirus testing. 

In March 2022, VDPV3 was detected in stool specimens from an infant who had received a new diagnosis of PID and was hospitalized in Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (CHCMU). CCDC and partners in Chongqing investigated the case. This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 

The patient, a boy aged 1 year, was born in Guizhou province. He was initially admitted to CHCMU’s immunology division at age 6 months with persistent diarrhea, daily fevers, diffuse red papular rash, and lymphadenitis. He received a diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with heterozygous mutations in the ZAP70 gene, which is a rare autosomal recessive form of SCID caused by abnormal T-cell receptor signaling. Lymph node biopsy and culture found disseminated mycobacterial disease. He had received the recommended Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine (BCG) on the first day of life and subsequently developed recurrent localized abscesses and ulcers at the BCG vaccination site. His parents reported having sought treatment at a local hospital at this time; however, no documentation of any evaluation was available. The patient had also received 2 IPV doses at ages 2 and 3 months (May 24 and June 29, 2021, respectively) and the first bOPV dose at age 4 months (July 29, 2021), as recommended. Shortly after receipt of the first bOPV dose, he experienced left axillary lymphadenitis that ultimately involved right axillary, occipital, and cervical lymph nodes. He later acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and developed Pneumocystis yersini pneumonia. He died of respiratory failure in the CHCMU intensive care unit on May 3, 2022, at age 13 months. 

During the patient’s hospitalization, stool specimens were obtained on February 28 and March 1, 2022, and sent to the CCDC polio laboratory for testing in accordance with WHO recommendations (5). Four isolates obtained and tested by real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction were identified as type 3 poliovirus. Genetic sequencing of viral capsid VP1 coding region indicated that the four isolates diverged from type 3 Sabin strain by 22, 23, 22, and 24 nucleotides (2.4%–2.7%) and shared 15 nucleotide substitutions.","The first identified iVDPV case was reported in the United Kingdom in 1962; as of May 2020, only 149 cases have been reported worldwide (6). Most patients with iVDPV develop paralysis before they receive a diagnosis of immune deficiency and are typically detected through AFP surveillance. Other iVDPV cases have been detected through stool cultures obtained to diagnose enterovirus infection in children with suspected or confirmed PID. Among the three types of poliovirus, 56% of iVDPVs were type 2, 23% were type 3, 17% were type 1, and 4% were heterotypic mixtures (6). The incidence of iVDPV2 detection declined markedly after the global removal of OPV2 from routine immunization in 2016. Eleven cases of iVDPV were detected in China by AFP surveillance through 2021, before the case described in this report; among these previous cases, four patients died and seven stopped excreting poliovirus. 

Children with PID are affected by a range of inherited disorders that result in developmental defects or dysfunction of immune system components (7). Live vaccines are usually contraindicated in children with PID because of their risk for causing disease. Although prenatal screening programs can identify some PIDs, identification and diagnosis of PID requires consultation with specialists including clinical immunologists. Infants with PID might therefore receive BCG or OPV before receiving a diagnosis of PID, increasing the risk for disseminated mycobacterial disease and iVDPV infection. ZAP70 gene deficiency is very rare and manifests with typical clinical features of SCID early in life (8). Approximately one half of BCG-vaccinated SCID patients have developed BCG-associated manifestations (9). Therefore, dissemination after BCG vaccination might be the initial clinical sign of PID, after which, receipt of live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated. 

As the global initiative progresses toward polio eradication, identification of patients with PID is increasing in importance, because iVDPVs can jeopardize polio eradication efforts through long-term excretion by PID patients. To identify nonparalyzed iVDPV cases, GPEI has proposed augmenting AFP and environmental surveillance with poliovirus surveillance in children with PID diagnoses and is supporting implementation of iVDPV surveillance in several countries (6). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least one limitation. The infant’s death precluded collection of additional stool specimens to further assess virus mutations. The infant described in this report never experienced paralysis. Among known patients who excrete iVDPVs, approximately 30% do not experience paralysis (4). 

Surveillance among patients with PID has increased detection of iVDPVs in patients without paralysis (6). This early finding of a nonparalyzed iVDPV patient in the PID pilot project supports the development of a long-term plan and guidance for iVDPV surveillance in China. Comprehensive iVDPV surveillance requires awareness among clinical immunologists that children who receive a new diagnosis of PID should have stool specimens tested for poliovirus by contacting their local public health authorities. Currently, antiviral treatment of iVDPV infections is under development (10). Effective treatment clears prolonged or chronic infection among patients with PIDs and removes a potential source of poliovirus transmission. Integrated systematic poliovirus surveillance including AFP, environmental, and iVDPV surveillance is critical to detecting and containing all polioviruses and helping to achieve and sustain a world free of polio.","Corresponding author: Zhi-Yong Zhang, zzy510214@126.com.","Suggested citation for this article: Yao N, Liu Y, Xu J, et al.

In the current global monkeypox outbreak, HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are highly prevalent among persons with monkeypox. 

What is added by this report? 

Among 1,969 persons with monkeypox in eight U.S. jurisdictions, 38% had HIV infection, and 41% had an STI in the preceding year. Among persons with monkeypox, hospitalization was more common among persons with HIV infection than persons without HIV infection. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

It is important to leverage systems for delivering HIV and STI care and prevention and prioritize persons with HIV infection and STIs for vaccination. Screening for HIV and other STIs and other preventive care should be considered for persons evaluated for monkeypox, with HIV care and HIV preexposure prophylaxis offered to eligible persons.

High prevalences of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been reported in the current global monkeypox outbreak, which has affected primarily gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (1–5). In previous monkeypox outbreaks in Nigeria, concurrent HIV infection was associated with poor monkeypox clinical outcomes (6,7). Monkeypox, HIV, and STI surveillance data from eight U.S. jurisdictions* were matched and analyzed to examine HIV and STI diagnoses among persons with monkeypox and assess differences in monkeypox clinical features according to HIV infection status. Among 1,969 persons with monkeypox during May 17–July 22, 2022, HIV prevalence was 38%, and 41% had received a diagnosis of one or more other reportable STIs in the preceding year. Among persons with monkeypox and diagnosed HIV infection, 94% had received HIV care in the preceding year, and 82% had an HIV viral load of <200 copies/mL, indicating HIV viral suppression. Compared with persons without HIV infection, a higher proportion of persons with HIV infection were hospitalized (8% versus 3%). Persons with HIV infection or STIs are disproportionately represented among persons with monkeypox. It is important that public health officials leverage systems for delivering HIV and STI care and prevention to reduce monkeypox incidence in this population. Consideration should be given to prioritizing persons with HIV infection and STIs for vaccination against monkeypox. HIV and STI screening and other recommended preventive care should be routinely offered to persons evaluated for monkeypox, with linkage to HIV care or HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as appropriate. 

Eight health departments matched probable and confirmed cases of monkeypox† diagnosed through July 22, 2022, and occurring among persons aged ≥18 years, to local HIV and STI surveillance data using individually established methods that included various personal identifiers (e.g., name, soundex,§ date of birth, address, and telephone number). Matched data were deidentified and securely transmitted to CDC for analysis. 

Among persons with monkeypox, prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection, determined through local HIV surveillance matches,¶ was calculated. HIV surveillance data were used to assess receipt of HIV care,** HIV viral suppression (an indication of antiretroviral therapy use),†† most recent CD4 count,§§ and time since HIV diagnosis (8). STI surveillance data were used to assess chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis diagnoses. Monkeypox signs, symptoms, and outcomes were compared according to HIV infection status. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶ 

Among 1,969 persons aged ≥18 years with monkeypox diagnosed during May 17–July 22, 2022, in eight participating jurisdictions, 755 (38%) had received an HIV diagnosis, 816 (41%) had another reportable STI diagnosed in the preceding year, and 363 (18%) had both; 1,208 (61%) persons had either (Table 1) (Table 2).*** Since May 1, 2022, 19 (1%) persons with monkeypox had received an HIV diagnosis, and 297 (15%) had received an STI diagnosis. Persons with monkeypox and HIV infection more commonly had received an STI diagnosis in the preceding year (48%) than had those without HIV infection (37%). 

Among persons with monkeypox, the weekly percentage with concurrent HIV infection increased over time (31%–44% by July). The percentage of persons with monkeypox who had HIV infection was higher in older age groups: among persons aged 18–24 years, HIV prevalence was 21%, and among those aged ≥55 years, was 59%. HIV prevalence among persons with monkeypox also varied by race and ethnicity, ranging from a high of 63% among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons, to 41% among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons, 28% among non-Hispanic White persons, and 22% among non-Hispanic Asian persons. 

Among 755 persons with monkeypox and HIV infection, 713 (94%) received HIV care in the preceding year, 618 (82%) were virally suppressed, and 586 (78%) had CD4 count ≥350/μL. The median interval since HIV diagnosis was 10 years (IQR = 6–15 years). Data on HIV PrEP use were available for 172 (14%) persons without HIV infection, 115 (67%) of whom reported current PrEP use. 

Compared with persons with monkeypox who did not have HIV infection, those with HIV infection were more likely to report rectal pain (34% versus 26%), tenesmus (20% versus 12%), rectal bleeding (19% versus 12%), purulent or bloody stools (15% versus 8%), and proctitis (13% versus 7%), but were less likely to report lymphadenopathy (48% versus 53%) (Figure). The prevalence of other signs and symptoms was similar among persons with monkeypox with and without HIV infection. Among 564 persons with monkeypox, HIV, known HIV viral load values, and signs and symptoms data, the 51 persons with unsuppressed HIV viral load were more likely than were the 513 with suppressed viral load to have lymphadenopathy (59% versus 46%), generalized pruritis (59% versus 42%), rectal bleeding (25% versus 18%), and purulent or bloody stools (22% versus 14%). Compared with persons with CD4 counts ≥350/μL, those with CD4 counts <350/μL more commonly experienced fever (69% versus 59%) and generalized pruritis (53% versus 42%). 

Among 1,308 (66%) persons with information on hospitalization, the proportion of persons hospitalized with monkeypox was lower among those without HIV infection (3%, 26 of 798) than among those with HIV infection (8%, 42 of 510). Among 45 persons with monkeypox and HIV infection who were not virally suppressed, 12 (27%) were hospitalized, and among 61 with a CD4 count <350 cells/μL, nine (15%) were hospitalized. 

","View LargerAmong persons with monkeypox in eight U.S. jurisdictions, prevalences of concurrent HIV infection and reportable STI diagnoses within the preceding 12 months were high, consistent with previous reports (1–5). To date, most U.S. monkeypox cases have occurred among MSM (4), who have higher prevalences of HIV infection and STIs than the general population. However, in this analysis, the percentage of persons with monkeypox who had HIV infection (38%) was higher than national HIV prevalence estimates for U.S. MSM (23%); this finding was also true when comparing Monkeypox virus and HIV coinfection among Black persons (63%), Hispanic persons (41%), and persons aged ≥55 years (59%) to overall HIV prevalences among Black MSM (39%), Hispanic MSM (19%), and MSM aged 50–60 years (32%), respectively (9). Increasing HIV prevalence among persons with monkeypox over time suggests that monkeypox might be increasingly transmitted among networks of persons with HIV infection, underscoring the importance of leveraging HIV and STI care and prevention delivery systems for monkeypox vaccination and prevention efforts.††† Consideration should be given to prioritizing persons with HIV infection and STIs for vaccination and other prevention efforts. HIV and STI screening and other recommended preventive care§§§ should be routinely offered to persons evaluated for monkeypox, with linkage to HIV care or HIV PrEP, as appropriate. 

The proportion of persons with Monkeypox virus and HIV coinfection who received HIV care (94%) exceeded the overall percentage of persons with diagnosed HIV infection who received care in 2020 (74%) (8). Approximately two thirds of persons with monkeypox without HIV infection for whom data were available reported HIV PrEP use, whereas nationally, an estimated 25% of eligible persons received an HIV PrEP prescription in 2020 (8). Moreover, 41% of persons with monkeypox had received a diagnosis of another reportable STI in the preceding year. These findings suggest that reported monkeypox cases are occurring among persons with recent access to HIV and sexual health services. Referral bias might partially explain these findings, as persons with monkeypox signs and symptoms who have established connections with HIV or sexual health providers might be more likely to seek care (2), and these providers might be more likely to recognize and test for Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox signs and symptoms might have led persons with HIV infection who have not been in HIV care to reengage in care. Persons with monkeypox signs and symptoms who are not engaged in routine HIV or sexual health care, or who experience milder signs and symptoms, might be less likely to have their Monkeypox virus infection diagnosed. To ensure appropriate diagnosis and treatment, it is important that health care providers who do not specialize in HIV or sexual health become familiar with the clinical guidance for monkeypox diagnosis and treatment.¶¶¶ 

The higher prevalence of rectal signs and symptoms among persons with HIV infection could be related to differences in site of exposure, increased biologic susceptibility, or other factors. Rectal signs and symptoms did not vary by HIV immune status (CD4 count <350/μL versus ≥350 μL), supporting differences in site of exposure as a likely explanation. In a prospective cohort in Spain, MSM with monkeypox who engaged in receptive anal sex were more likely to report proctitis and systemic signs and symptoms preceding rash (3). When evaluating patients with rectal signs and symptoms, care providers should consider monkeypox and the possibility of concurrent rectal STIs. Understanding whether rectal signs and symptoms can precede rash onset or occur when rash is absent or unrecognized (because of anatomic site or small number of lesions) will help inform guidance for Monkeypox virus testing and new diagnostic approaches. 

Limited data suggest that persons with HIV infection, particularly those with low CD4 counts or without HIV viral suppression, were more commonly hospitalized during their monkeypox illness than were persons without HIV infection. However, because data on reason for hospitalization are incomplete, it is not known whether this represents more severe monkeypox illness. Ongoing monitoring of outcomes of monkeypox by HIV infection status is important (7). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, this analysis was limited to diagnosed and reported monkeypox cases in eight jurisdictions and might not be generalizable to all U.S. monkeypox cases. Second, incomplete data on clinical signs and symptoms and hospitalization might affect the associations observed by HIV infection status. Third, some persons with undiagnosed HIV infection might have been misclassified as not having HIV, which could reduce differences in outcomes by HIV infection status. Fourth, local matching might have underestimated the prevalences of HIV infection and STIs by not including diagnoses reported in other jurisdictions or recent diagnoses. Finally, this analysis did not assess the relative contribution of structural, social, behavioral, or biologic factors to higher HIV infection and STI prevalences among persons with monkeypox. Further studies could improve understanding of such factors, monkeypox outcomes, and the impact of vaccination and treatment. 

Public health efforts should continue to ensure equitable access to monkeypox screening, prevention, and treatment, particularly among MSM. It is important that systems for delivering HIV and STI care and prevention be leveraged for monkeypox evaluation, vaccination and other prevention interventions, and treatment (10). Data on diagnosis of HIV infections and STIs in close temporal association to monkeypox diagnosis reinforce the importance of offering recommended testing, prevention, and treatment services for HIV, STIs, and other syndemic conditions to MSM and other persons evaluated for monkeypox.**** Routine matching of monkeypox, HIV, and STI surveillance data to monitor trends and clinical characteristics of persons with coinfections can further inform public health interventions.","Corresponding author: Kathryn G.

Testing for Monkeypox virus, using Food and Drug Administration 510(k)–cleared non-variola Orthopoxvirus real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and laboratory developed real-time PCR tests, is critical for diagnosis of suspected cases. 

What is added by this report? 

Three persons with atypical rashes, uncharacteristic illnesses, and absence of risk factors or an epidemiologic link to a known monkeypox case received false-positive real-time PCR test results; late cycle threshold values were all ≥34. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

When testing specimens from patients with atypical signs and symptoms or without epidemiologic links or risk factors or where these are unknown, laboratories should reextract and retest specimens with real-time PCR Ct values that are high (≥34) to avoid unnecessary medical treatment and expenditure of public health resources.

Since May 2022, approximately 20,000 cases of monkeypox have been identified in the United States, part of a global outbreak occurring in approximately 90 countries and currently affecting primarily gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (1). Monkeypox virus (MPXV) spreads from person to person through close, prolonged contact; a small number of cases have occurred in populations who are not MSM (e.g., women and children), and testing is recommended for persons who meet the suspected case definition* (1). CDC previously developed five real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for detection of orthopoxviruses from lesion specimens (2,3). CDC was granted 510(k) clearance for the nonvariola-orthopoxvirus (NVO)–specific PCR assay by the Food and Drug Administration. This assay was implemented within the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) in the early 2000s and became critical for early detection of MPXV and implementation of public health action in previous travel-associated cases as well as during the current outbreak (4–7). PCR assays (NVO and other Orthopoxvirus laboratory developed tests [LDT]) represent the primary tool for monkeypox diagnosis. These tests are highly sensitive, and cross-contamination from other MPXV specimens being processed, tested, or both alongside negative specimens can occasionally lead to false-positive results. This report describes three patients who had atypical rashes and no epidemiologic link to a monkeypox case or known risk factors; these persons received diagnoses of monkeypox based on late cycle threshold (Ct) values ≥34, which were false-positive test results. The initial diagnoses were followed by administration of antiviral treatment (i.e., tecovirimat) and JYNNEOS vaccine postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to patients’ close contacts. After receiving subsequent testing, none of the three patients was confirmed to have monkeypox. Knowledge gained from these and other cases resulted in changes to CDC guidance. When testing for monkeypox in specimens from patients without an epidemiologic link or risk factors or who do not meet clinical criteria (or where these are unknown), laboratory scientists should reextract and retest specimens with late Ct values (based on this report, Ct ≥34 is recommended) (8). CDC can be consulted for complex cases including those that appear atypical or questionable cases and can perform additional viral species- and clade-specific PCR testing and antiorthopoxvirus serologic testing. 

The three patients described in this report were not MSM, and all had an atypical rash (i.e., without the characteristic progression over 2–4 weeks from pustular to deep-seated, umbilicated lesions). The patients initially received positive Orthopoxvirus real-time PCR test results, with high Ct values (≥34); the positive PCR results were followed by implementation of clinical and public health recommendations for monkeypox, including antiviral treatment and PEP.† This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§

Description of Patients 
Patient A, a healthy pregnant woman (estimated 37 weeks’ gestation) was evaluated for labor and was noted to have a pruritic erythematous rash on her arms, abdomen, upper back, calves, and shins. Her lesions, not typical for monkeypox, had irregular borders, and were different sizes and in different stages of development (i.e., tan papules, crusted papules, pustules, and hyperpigmented macules) in the same anatomic locations, with reported onset 5 weeks earlier. No genital lesions were present. She did not report typical prodromal signs or symptoms of monkeypox (e.g., body aches, lymphadenopathy, fever, or chills). A household member was reported to have a similar rash, with onset 4 days before that in patient A; that person’s rash resolved within 1 week, and no testing was performed; no epidemiologic link to a person with monkeypox was identified. Patient A had no interstate or international travel during the 3 weeks preceding rash onset. She reported varicella infection and receipt of smallpox vaccination as a child. Tests for varicella-zoster virus, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, cryptococcosis, and histoplasmosis were performed, all with negative results. A swab from a pustular forearm lesion, obtained 53 days after rash onset yielded a positive NVO test result (Table). Two days after receiving the result, the woman had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery of a healthy neonate. The state health department and CDC clinicians recommended several measures until lesions resolved: 1) initiation of monkeypox infection-control precautions¶ in the hospital, 2) precautions to prevent skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant,** 3) designation of another household member as the primary caregiver, 4) delay of breastfeeding, and 5) disposal of breast milk. Because of concern for congenital or perinatal transmission, vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV) was administered to the neonate under a single patient emergency Investigational New Drug application. Further testing with a Clade II (i.e., West African) MPXV–specific real-time PCR LDT was inconclusive. Because of the discordant results, serum from patient A obtained on day 42 after rash onset was sent to CDC for serologic analysis; no antiorthopoxvirus antibodies were detected, arguing against orthopoxvirus infection (9). The recommendations restricting contact with the baby and for delaying breastfeeding were discontinued after rash resolution when the infant was aged 21 days (Figure). The patient’s skin lesions were most likely attributable to bed bugs, which was a diagnosis that the clinical care team considered initially but set aside upon receipt of the positive NVO result. 

Patient B is an elementary school–aged, previously healthy child (Table). The child developed influenza-like symptoms followed 2 days later by raised lesions on the face. The next day, lesions had spread to the trunk, back, and arms. The lesions were initially papulopustular, and over the course of 2 days became ulcerated and crusted. No epidemiologic link to a person with monkeypox was identified. A swab of a facial lesion tested positive by an orthopoxvirus generic LDT. Treatment with tecovirimat was started because the child had periorbital lesions and because of concern for potential ocular autoinoculation and development of sight-threatening disease. The child lived with four other persons and had engaged in a contact sport when the rash was present. The child isolated at home, and all family members received PEP with JYNNEOS vaccine; PEP for teammates was held pending reextraction and retesting of the original specimen (Figure). The subsequent result was negative, and the child was released from isolation. Enterovirus PCR testing was positive, suggesting a diagnosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease. 

Patient C is an infant who visited the United States with both parents for approximately 1 month and subsequently traveled to another country with four other families for vacation. During that trip, the infant experienced diarrhea followed by lymphadenopathy, and 2 days later, after returning to the United States, developed fever and a rash (Table). The rash was described as maculopapular and vesicular, and started on the arms and legs progressing to the earlobe, chest, scalp, and lower abdomen; the rash scabbed over 2 weeks later. One abdominal lesion tested positive by NVO and an orthopoxvirus generic LDT; two other lesions tested negative. The infant was treated with oral tecovirimat. No epidemiologic link to a person with monkeypox was identified. Over a 15-day period starting on the second day of the vacation, five of 11 children (including patient C) and four of 14 adults from the families who vacationed with the infant experienced rashes that varied in appearance. Among some of the children, the rash looked like insect bites and not consistent with monkeypox; among others, the rash was vesicular or pustular involving the arms, legs, feet, fingers, or face, and eventually scabbing over. Results of NVO testing of lesions on four children and four adults were negative or inconclusive. A multijurisdictional investigation was launched to determine potential exposures and administer PEP to all family members. Twelve adults and seven children (aged 0–14 years) received PEP with JYNNEOS. Because of the ongoing investigation, multiple families changed travel plans, and patient C’s family postponed travel back to their country of residence for approximately 4 weeks. Serum from two adults and four children (including patient C) obtained 3–31 days after rash onset did not detect the presence of antiorthopoxvirus antibodies (Figure).","Evaluation of these three patients for monkeypox highlights the need for caution in interpreting single laboratory test findings in patients with a low pretest probability of infection; this includes lack of an epidemiologic link, non-MSM populations (e.g., women and children, who currently account for <2% of confirmed monkeypox cases), and signs, symptoms, or rash progression inconsistent with monkeypox. This approach is similar to the caution recommended in evaluating other laboratory tests when pretest probability is low (e.g., D-dimer results for a deep vein thrombosis or serology for Lyme disease)†† (10). Multiple clinical features in each of these three patients were inconsistent with monkeypox, including an atypical rash that was inconsistent with the characteristic progression of monkeypox lesions, as well as the absence of an epidemiologic link to a known case of monkeypox. The Ct values of all initial positive test results were high (≥34) indicating a low level of viral DNA. Cautious interpretation of test results is warranted when the pretest probability of monkeypox is low. As monkeypox testing has expanded, CDC recommends that laboratory professionals verify positive diagnostic results (8) for Orthopoxvirus or MPXV DNA in specimens with high Ct values, especially from persons who do not meet epidemiologic risk criteria for monkeypox or for whom lesions do not progress as expected. Molecular tests (e.g., real-time PCR tests) are highly specific and sensitive; however, when epidemiologic criteria are absent or unknown and the Ct value is high (generally ≥34), CDC recommends reextraction and retesting of the specimen. 

Monkeypox currently occurs predominantly among MSM, although infection can occur in any person after close physical contact with persons with monkeypox or items that have been in contact with lesions, such as clothing or bedding. Because the positive predictive value in populations with low disease incidence is lower than that in populations with a higher disease incidence, laboratory results in persons with low pretest probability of infection should be carefully examined and reviewed, and other plausible diagnoses (e.g., hand, foot, and mouth disease; varicella; molluscum contagiosum) should be considered. The clinical course of illness should be reviewed, including documenting the lesions with photographs. CDC can be consulted for atypical or questionable cases and can perform additional viral-specific and clade-specific PCR testing and antiorthopoxvirus serology.","Corresponding author: Faisal Minhaj, fminhaj@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Minhaj FS, Petras JK, Brown JA, et al.

Nitazenes were created as a potential pain reliever medication nearly 60 years ago but have never been approved for use in the United States (2). Laboratory test results indicate that the potency of certain nitazene analogs (e.g., isotonitazene, protonitazene, and etonitazene) greatly exceeds that of fentanyl, whereas the potency of the analog metonitazene is similar to fentanyl (3,4). Naloxone has been effective in reversing nitazene-involved overdoses, but multiple doses might be needed (3,4). The prevalence of nitazene deaths in the United States is unknown and the frequency of nitazene involvement in overdose deaths in Tennessee has not yet been assessed. However, of concern is that nitazenes are increasingly recorded in toxicology reports and death certificate cause-of-death fields. Given their potency, raising awareness about nitazenes and implementing strategies to reduce harm through increased testing, surveillance, and linkage to treatment for substance use disorders are of vital importance. 

The Office of Informatics and Analytics at the Tennessee Department of Health conducts routine surveillance of fatal drug overdoses using the Tennessee State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (TN SUDORS). The surveillance system collects sociodemographic information and circumstances associated with overdose deaths, including death scene information, autopsy reports, and toxicology reports for drug overdose deaths of unintentional and undetermined intent. For this analysis, nitazene-involved deaths were identified using a text search for the term “nitazene” (and common misspellings) in death certificate cause-of-death fields and in toxicology reports for deaths that occurred during January 1, 2019–December 31, 2021, with data available as of June 10, 2022. TN SUDORS data were examined for demographic characteristics and circumstances surrounding deaths. Tennessee death certificate data for 2021 are provisional, as are SUDORS data for July–December 2021. This analysis was determined to be exempt from review by the Tennessee Department of Health’s Institutional Review Board and was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.* 

During 2019–2021, a total of 52 nitazene-involved fatal drug overdoses were identified using TN SUDORS data, including no cases in 2019, 10 in 2020, and 42 in 2021 (Table). In 2020, most of nitazene-involved deaths were attributed to isotonitazene, but in 2021, most were attributed to metonitazene. Among the 10 nitazene-involved overdose deaths identified in 2020, the average decedent age was 40.6 years, and nine (90.0%) decedents were White males. In 2021, the average decedent age was similar (42.6 years); a smaller percentage of the 42 decedents were male (66.7%) and White (88.1%). Whereas nitazene-involved deaths increased in 2021, 85.7% were attributed to metonitazene, which has a lower potency compared with other nitazenes. All nitazene-involved overdoses involved multiple substances. During both 2020 and 2021, the most frequent route of administration was injection (18; 34.6%). Other routes of administration were smoking, snorting, and ingestion. In addition to fentanyl (59.6%), other co-occurring substances included methamphetamine (46.2%), amphetamine (25.0%), and flualprazolam (13.5%). 

Most nitazene-involved deaths in Tennessee were identified in Knox County. This apparent high prevalence is most likely because Knox County’s Regional Forensic Center sends blood samples for secondary laboratory testing to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) (5); traditional laboratory panels do not always capture nitazenes. Therefore, nitazene-involved deaths that occur in other counties of Tennessee are likely to be undercounted. DEA provides laboratory testing as a free resource and encourages state and national forensic centers to submit their samples for additional testing to assist in the accurate counting of deaths and to better guide drug overdose prevention efforts. 

Naloxone was only administered to 12 (23%) persons with nitazene-involved fatal overdoses. Given naloxone’s effectiveness in preventing fatal overdoses, more frequent administration of naloxone by first responders, bystanders, and clinicians is important. Implementing naloxone training and distribution efforts throughout all states is also necessary. As with fentanyl, multiple naloxone doses might be required because of the potency of nitazene† and can be safely administered. In addition, contacting emergency services is necessary to provide immediate medical attention to persons who might be overdosing. 

Four times as many nitazene-involved overdoses were identified in Tennessee in 2021 than in 2020, and this number could be underestimated because of low testing frequency. Nitazenes are an emerging group of highly potent psychoactive substances, tests for which are often not included in standard toxicology panels. Given their potency, raising awareness about nitazenes and implementing strategies to reduce harm through increased testing, surveillance, and linkage to treatment for substance use disorders are of vital importance. More data are required to better understand this emerging group of psychoactive substances in the United States.

Before emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant, infectious SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to be cultured at high cycle threshold (Ct) values. Based on this, low Ct values, which are suggestive of high RNA levels, are sometimes used as surrogate markers for infectiousness. 

What is added by this report? 

In a longitudinal study including daily nasal swabbing, although Omicron BA.1 sublineage infections exhibited higher Ct values than did pre-Omicron infections, culturable Omicron virus was still detected. Among virus-positive specimens, Ct values were higher for Omicron than for pre-Omicron specimens, especially during the first week of illness. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Supporting CDC guidance, these data show that Ct values likely do not provide a consistent proxy for infectiousness across SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Before emergence in late 2021 of the highly transmissible B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1,2), several studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to be cultured from specimens with high cycle threshold (Ct) values§ from real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests (suggesting low viral RNA levels) (3). Although CDC and others do not recommend attempting to correlate Ct values with the amount of infectious virus in the original specimen (4,5), low Ct values are sometimes used as surrogate markers for infectiousness in clinical, public health, or research settings without access to virus culture (5). However, the consistency in reliability of this practice across SARS-CoV-2 variants remains uncertain because Omicron-specific data on infectious virus shedding, including its relationship with RNA levels, are limited. In the current analysis, nasal specimens collected from an ongoing longitudinal cohort¶ (6,7) of nonhospitalized participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results living in the San Francisco Bay Area** were used to generate Ct values and assess for the presence of culturable SARS-CoV-2 virus; findings were compared between specimens from participants infected with pre-Omicron variants and those infected with the Omicron BA.1 sublineage. Among specimens with culturable virus detected, Ct values were higher (suggesting lower RNA levels) during Omicron BA.1 infections than during pre-Omicron infections, suggesting variant-specific differences in viral dynamics. Supporting CDC guidance, these data show that Ct values likely do not provide a consistent proxy for infectiousness across SARS-CoV-2 variants. 

As part of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study, persons with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (based on a positive clinical real-time RT-PCR test result) and their household members were recruited within 5 days of the first symptom onset in the household (or first RNA-positive test result if the infected person was asymptomatic). All participants self-collected nasal swab specimens once daily for 2 weeks from the first onset in the household; some participants also provided a serum specimen at enrollment to identify evidence of previous infection.†† In a single laboratory, real-time RT-PCR targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and envelope protein (E) genes§§ (8) was used to detect RNA and to determine Ct values, whole genome sequencing was used to identify the infecting variant strain and sublineage, and the presence or absence of culturable virus was assessed by cytopathic effect observed in tissue culture.¶¶ Enrollment sera were tested for the presence or absence of anti-N immunoglobulin G (IgG) per manufacturer (Abbott) instructions at a clinical laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco. 

Participants with confirmed infection (based on having at least one nasal specimen test positive by real-time RT-PCR for both N and E) were included, and the analysis was limited to specimens collected within 14 days of onset for each participant (for symptomatic patients, onset was defined as the first day of symptoms,*** and for asymptomatic participants, as the first RNA-positive specimen [i.e., positive for both N and E real-time RT-PCR targets]). Participants aged ≥18 years were classified as adults, and those aged <18 years were classified as children and adolescents. Vaccination status was classified as fully vaccinated††† (completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series) or unvaccinated; no participants were partially vaccinated, and no participants had received a booster dose ≥14 days before either symptom onset or enrollment. Ct values of Omicron specimens were compared with those of pre-Omicron specimens among all specimens, among RNA-positive specimens, and among specimens with viable virus detected in tissue culture (virus-positive specimens). With E-specific Ct value as the main outcome and variant group (Omicron versus pre-Omicron) as the main exposure, mixed linear regression models were used to account for clustering of multiple specimens per participant, and to control for potential confounding by age group and vaccination status. When Ct values among all or RNA-positive specimens were compared, an interaction term of the product of variant and infectiousness (i.e., virus-positivity) was included; this interaction term was excluded when Ct values within virus-positive specimens were assessed. Longitudinal sampling of infected participants resulted in some subsequently negative real-time RT-PCR specimens (no target detected); these were included in the all-specimen models and were assigned a Ct value of 40 for analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with comparable models using N-specific Ct values as the outcome. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata Software (version 16.1; StataCorp). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§ 

A total of 1,147 nasal swab specimens from 124 participants were analyzed; among 17 participants infected with Omicron variants (all BA.1 sublineages) and 107 infected with pre-Omicron variants,¶¶¶ 149 and 998 specimens, respectively, were collected (Table). Timing of specimen collection after onset (in each participant) was similar in both groups (median = 8 days; IQR = 6–11 days). Among the 17 participants with Omicron BA.1 infections, nine (53%) were adults and 10 (59%) were fully vaccinated. Among 107 participants with pre-Omicron infections, 92 (86%) were adults and 35 (33%) were fully vaccinated. Nearly all participants were symptomatic (16 of 17 participants with Omicron BA.1 infection and 100 of 107 with pre-Omicron infection). No participants reported previous infection, and among 58 participants with available sera, none had detectable anti-N IgG at enrollment. 

Accounting for age group and vaccination status, E-specific Ct values in all specimens were significantly higher in Omicron specimens than in pre-Omicron specimens (Ct difference = 4.45, p<0.001).**** When analysis was limited to RNA-positive specimens, a similar trend was observed (Ct difference = 3.90, p<0.001).†††† Despite these higher Ct values in Omicron than in pre-Omicron specimens, culturable virus was detected in specimens from a similar percentage of participants in both variant groups (Omicron = 76%; pre-Omicron = 71%), a similar percentage of total specimens (Omicron = 26%; pre-Omicron: 30%), and was detected for a similar duration following onset (median = 6 days, IQR = 5–8 days for both Omicron and pre-Omicron specimens). Among virus-positive specimens, E-specific Ct values were significantly higher in Omicron specimens than pre-Omicron specimens (Ct difference = 5.77, p<0.001).§§§§ This difference was observed as early as day 3 after onset through day 8 after onset (Figure 1). When stratified by age group or vaccination status (Figure 2), virus-positive Omicron specimens were associated with higher E-specific Ct values than were virus-positive pre-Omicron specimens (p<0.01). Similar findings were observed in the N-specific analysis (p<0.001).","In this study, and consistent with other published findings (9), Ct values detected in nasal specimens were higher (suggesting lower RNA levels) in those obtained from participants infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 sublineage than in those from participants infected with pre-Omicron variants. However, despite these higher Ct values, culturable virus was detected from a similar proportion of participants in both variant groups, and for a similar duration following onset; consistent with a recent report (10), participants infected with Omicron BA.1 had detectable culturable virus for a median of 6 days after onset. Notably, among these virus-positive (i.e., potentially infectious) specimens, Ct values were higher than were those for pre-Omicron specimens, especially during the first week of illness. In addition, these differences between Omicron and pre-Omicron infections were observed in adults and in children and adolescents and were irrespective of vaccination status. Presence of culturable Omicron BA.1 in nasal specimens, despite high Ct values, might contribute to the high levels of Omicron transmission observed in other studies (2). Further, these findings highlight variant-specific differences in viral dynamics, specifically, differences in the relationship between RNA and shedding of infectious virus. 

Strengths of this study include the robust prospective longitudinal nature of nasal swab specimen collection. Similar findings were observed from two distinct real-time RT-PCR targets, both of which have been shown to reliably amplify both Omicron and pre-Omicron variants. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, this is a single-site study with a small number of participants infected with the Omicron BA.1 sublineage; thus, these findings might not be representative of all infected persons. Replication of these findings with additional participants is necessary and is ongoing. Second, approximately one half of the participants did not provide an enrollment serum specimen; thus, it was not possible to comprehensively assess the incidence of previous infection. Finally, duplication was not carried out on multiple real-time RT-PCR platforms across laboratories. 

Virus-positive (i.e., potentially infectious) specimens from participants infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants had significantly higher Ct values than did virus-positive specimens from participants infected with pre-Omicron variants. Supporting CDC guidance (4), these data highlight that Ct values likely do not provide a reliable or consistent proxy for infectiousness across SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Corresponding author: J.

COVID-19 vaccines have been recommended for children aged 6 months–5 years since June 2022; approximately one million doses were administered to persons in this age group during June–August 2022. 

What is added by this report? 

Local and systemic reactions after vaccination with either BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines were reported for children aged 6 months–4 years and 6 months–5 years, respectively, to v-safe and VAERS safety monitoring systems. Serious adverse events were rarely reported. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Initial vaccine safety data indicate that among young children, local and systemic reactions are expected after COVID-19 vaccination and serious adverse events are rare.

On June 17, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to include children aged 6 months–4 years for receipt of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) (administered as 3 doses, 3 μg [0.2 mL] each) and children aged 6 months–5 years for receipt of mRNA-1273 (Moderna) (administered as 2 doses, 25 μg [0.25 mL] each) (1,2). In preauthorization clinical trials, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was administered to 3,013 children aged 6 months–4 years (3) and the Moderna vaccine was administered to 5,011 children aged 6 months–5 years (4). Most adverse events reported in these trials were mild to moderate in severity and no serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported. To characterize postauthorization safety of COVID-19 vaccine primary series among young children, CDC reviewed adverse events and health impacts after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that were reported to v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based U.S. safety surveillance system established by CDC to monitor adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination (https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/), and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a U.S. passive vaccine safety surveillance system managed by CDC and FDA. During June 18–August 21, 2022, approximately 599,457children aged 6 months–4 years received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 440,773 aged 6 months–5 years received the Moderna vaccine*; approximately 23,266 children were enrolled in v-safe after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. The most frequent systemic reactions reported to v-safe after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were irritability or crying among approximately one half of children aged 6 months–2 years. Among children aged ≥3 years, systemic reactions after vaccination were less frequently reported; injection site pain was the most frequently reported reaction among these older children. VAERS received a total of 1,017 reports of adverse events after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccination among children aged 6 months–4 years and children aged 6 months–5 years; 998 (98.1%) events were classified as nonserious and 19 (1.9%) as serious. No reports of myocarditis after vaccination were reported. These initial safety findings are similar to those from preauthorization clinical trials (3,4). Health care providers and parents of young children should be aware that local and systemic reactions are expected after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine and that serious adverse events are rare. 

On June 20, 2022, v-safe was modified to allow parents and guardians to enroll children aged 6 months–4 years after any mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. Text message reminders are sent to parents or guardians to complete online health surveys for their child.† Health surveys sent in the first postvaccination week include questions about local injection site and systemic reactions (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe) and health impacts.§ Specific questions were included for children aged 6 months–2 years who might not be able to describe reactions or who might experience reactions that are different from those experienced by children aged ≥3 years.¶ CDC’s v-safe call center contacts registrants who indicate that medical care was received after vaccination and encourages completion of a VAERS report. 

VAERS is a national passive vaccine safety surveillance system managed by CDC and FDA that monitors adverse events after vaccination (5). VAERS accepts reports of postvaccination adverse events from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public.** Signs, symptoms, and diagnostic findings in VAERS reports are assigned Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms (MedDRA PTs) by VAERS staff.†† Reports of serious events to VAERS§§ were reviewed by CDC and FDA physicians to form a consensus clinical impression based on available data. Using selected MedDRA PTs, a search was performed to identify possible cases of myocarditis, a rare adverse event that has been associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (6). 

Local and systemic reactions and health impacts reported to v-safe during the week after vaccination were described for children aged 6 months–4 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and children aged 6 months–5 years who received Moderna vaccine during June 18–August 21, 2022. VAERS reports were described by serious and nonserious status, demographic characteristics, and MedDRA PTs. Analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute); p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. These surveillance activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶ 


Review of v-safe Data 
During June 18–August 21, 2022, v-safe enrolled 4,749 children aged 6 months–2 years and 3,792 aged 3–4 years who had received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 8,338 children aged 6 months–2 years and 6,387 aged 3–5 years who had received Moderna vaccine (Table 1). Most children (22,695; 97.6%) did not receive any other vaccine at the time of receipt of the first COVID-19 dose. Local and systemic reactions reported during the week after receipt of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were most frequently reported on the day after vaccination. Local reactions were reported for 900 (19.0%) children aged 6 months–2 years and 1,078 (28.4%) aged 3–4 years after the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose and for 1,601 (19.2%) aged 6 months–2 years and 2,072 (32.4%) aged 3–5 years after the first Moderna dose. Systemic reactions were reported for 2,649 (55.8%) children aged 6 months–2 years and for 1,220 (32.2%) children aged 3–4 years after receipt of the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose and for 4,647 (55.7%) children aged 6 months–2 years and for 2,204 (34.5%) children aged 3–5 years after the first Moderna vaccine dose. The most frequently reported reactions after receipt of either Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines among children aged 6 months–2 years were irritability or crying, sleepiness, and fever; among children aged 3–5 years, the most frequently reported reactions were injection site pain, fatigue, and fever. Most reports described reactions as mild to moderate in severity (Table 2). 

Parents of approximately 1,323 (5.7% ) and 803 (6.5%) of children aged 6 months–5 years reported that their child was unable to perform normal daily activities in the week after dose 1 and dose 2, respectively of either vaccine. Approximately 741 (2%) reported seeking medical care in the week after either dose; most medical care was received via a clinic appointment (450; 1.3%). Four children received care at a hospital after vaccination; two respondents indicated the hospitalization was unrelated to vaccination, one was unwilling to provide further information, and one completed a VAERS report (Table 3). 


Review of VAERS Data 
During June 18– August 21, 2022, VAERS received and processed 496 reports of adverse events among children aged 6 months–4 years who had received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 521 reports for children aged 6 months–5 years who had received Moderna vaccine (Table 3).*** Among Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients for whom a VAERS report was submitted, the median age was 3 years, and 249 (50.2%) reports were for events among males. Among Moderna vaccine recipients, the median age was 2 years, and 272 (52.2%) reports were for events among males. Most children (978; 96.2%) for whom reports were submitted received Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine as the sole vaccine administered. 

Overall, 998 (98.1%) VAERS reports were for nonserious events, including 486 (98.0%) after Pfizer-BioNTech and 512 (98.3%) after Moderna vaccination. The most commonly reported events (455; 44.7%) were related to vaccination errors (e.g., incorrect dose administered, product administered to patient of inappropriate age, or product or preparation issue); among 278 reports of vaccination errors after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech and 177 reports after receipt of Moderna vaccines, 45 (9.9%) reports indicated that an adverse health event had occurred. Nonserious adverse events most commonly reported were fever (197; 19.8%), rash (95; 9.5%), vomiting (79; 7.9%), urticaria (66; 6.6%), and fatigue (60; 6.0%). 

Nineteen serious events were reported to VAERS. Eight reports were for seizure, six of which were reports among children who were afebrile on medical evaluation; one child had a recorded temperature of 102.7°F (39.3°C) and temperature was not reported for the other child. Two children with preexisting diagnoses of structural brain abnormalities experienced seizures in the days after vaccination. One child experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis several hours after vaccination; this child received a partial vaccine dose accompanied by a needle malfunction followed by revaccination with an appropriate dose. No reports of myocarditis after vaccination were reported.","Approximately, one million young children have received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The findings in this report are consistent with those from safety data from preauthorization clinical trials for young children (3,4). Trial participants aged 6 months–4 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 6 months–5 years who received Moderna vaccine most frequently reported mild or moderate local and systemic reactions; no serious adverse events judged to be related to vaccination were reported in the trial data (3,4). Initial postauthorization safety monitoring of 19 serious reports identified one report of febrile seizure plausibly associated with vaccination.

Systemic reactions were more frequently reported after COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months–2 years than for children aged 3–5 years. The most frequent reactions reported to v-safe for children aged 6 months–2 years included irritability or crying, sleepiness, and loss of appetite. These reactions are consistent with the clinical trial findings (3,4) and are common after childhood vaccination (7).

Among VAERS reports for Pfizer-BioNTech recipients aged 6 months–4 years and Moderna recipients aged 6 months–5 years, 98% or more were nonserious. Vaccination errors were among the most common events reported to VAERS in this age group. No adverse event was associated with vaccination errors in 92% of these reports. Children in these age groups are authorized to receive a smaller amount of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine than are older children (8); incorrect dosing by vaccine administrators in different childhood age groups might lead to vaccination errors. Continued education of vaccine providers might help reduce administration errors, including incorrect dosing, among children. Of the eight seizures reported to VAERS, only one was associated with a fever (39.3°C [102.7°F] ) occurring after COVID-19 vaccination and two were in children with structural brain abnormalities. Myocarditis is a rare adverse event that has been associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines; the risk appears highest among adolescents and decreases with decreasing age in childhood (6). No events of myocarditis were reported to VAERS after vaccination in children aged 6 months–5 years.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, v-safe is a voluntary program; as a result, v-safe data might not be representative of the vaccinated population. For example, although more doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine than Moderna vaccine were administered to young children in the United States during the surveillance period of this report, more v-safe reports were received for children who received Moderna vaccine. Second, VAERS is a passive reporting system and is subject to reporting biases and underreporting, especially of nonserious events (5). Third, Pfizer-BioNTech dose 3 data were not available at the time of this analysis. Finally, these data are limited by the short surveillance period and might change as safety monitoring continues and more doses are administered to children aged 6 months–5 years.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that all persons aged ≥6 months receive a COVID-19 vaccine (8). Initial vaccine safety monitoring in children aged 6 months–5 years are usually similar to those described in clinical trials, and no unexpected safety concerns were detected (3,4). Health care providers and parents of young children should be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and serious adverse events are rare. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates as needed to guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.","Corresponding author: Anne M.

In June 2022, COVID-19 vaccines were authorized for use in children aged 6 months–5 years. Intent to vaccinate and vaccination rates in children have been low. 

What is added by this report? 

During July 2021–May 2022, in a longitudinal cohort of 393 children aged <5 years in four states, parental intent to vaccinate children against COVID-19 and perception of COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness declined over a 3-month period, but intent to vaccinate and perceptions of vaccine safety returned to baseline after 6 months. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Identifying and addressing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in children aged <5 years and educating parents about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and safety in young children are critical to increasing pediatric COVID-19 vaccination coverage.

Approximately 12 million children and adolescents aged ≤18 years in the United States have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, since December 2019,* and COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates increased among children aged <5 years during the B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant peaks (1). In June 2022, the Food and Drug Administration amended the Emergency Use Authorization for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine to include use of the vaccine in children aged 6 months–4 years and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) for children 6 months–5 years, which CDC recommends all children receive.† Advance reports indicated that fewer than 50% of parents were willing to vaccinate their children aged <5 years (2,3). Using the Pediatric Research Observing Trends and Exposures in COVID-19 Timelines (PROTECT)§ (4) prospective cohort, changes in parental perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination¶ for children aged <5 years were examined during July 2021–May 2022. Among 393 parents who participated in a baseline survey, approximately 64%, 19%, and 10% reported they were likely, were unsure, or were unlikely, respectively, to have their child aged <5 years receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The odds of parents intending to vaccinate their child was lower 3 months after the baseline survey, (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.6–1.0) than at baseline. During the same period, parents also were less likely to perceive that COVID-19 vaccines were effective (aOR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.4–0.8) and safe (aOR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.5–0.9) compared with baseline. Intent to vaccinate and perception of safety increased 6 months after the baseline survey in unadjusted models (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.1–2.5; and OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.3–2.6, respectively), but were no longer significant after adjusting for the child’s receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result before survey completion, age, sex, race and ethnicity, health insurance, and study site. Enhanced efforts to address parental confidence in childhood vaccination and increase vaccination coverage among children aged <5 years are needed, including reinforcing the effectiveness and safety of vaccination against COVID-19. PROTECT is an ongoing prospective cohort that includes >2,300 children and adolescents aged 4 months–17 years; the study monitors infections with SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Utah (4). Children were recruited via community outreach from the public and from families participating in the HEROES-RECOVER longitudinal cohorts of essential and frontline workers (5,6). Upon enrollment, parents provided sociodemographic information, COVID-19 illness history, vaccination history, and their perceptions about COVID-19 vaccines for children. Participants are surveyed every 3 months. SARS-CoV-2 infections are identified among participant children through midturbinate nasal specimens collected weekly and tested via reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. Parents who completed the baseline survey and at least one follow-up survey were included in analysis. One child was randomly selected from households with two or more children aged <5 years to avoid household clustering. This study was restricted to 393 children aged <5 years who were enrolled in the PROTECT study during July 2021–May 2022. Vaccine intention was ascertained using baseline parental responses to the question, “What are the chances that [child] will get a COVID-19 vaccination?” Responses were grouped into three categories: unlikely (almost zero chance, very small chance); unsure (small chance, do not know, moderate chance); and likely (large chance, very large chance, almost certain). 

A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used for each question to evaluate whether within-parent responses changed from a neutral or negative response (unsure or unlikely) to a positive response 3 and 6 months after the baseline enrollment survey. All available surveys from participants in the analytic group were included in the GEE models. The survey time point was added as a categorical predictor to calculate the OR for vaccine intention and vaccine perceptions. In addition, ORs describe the likelihood of all participants providing more positive responses at the 3-month and 6-month surveys compared with the baseline survey. Both unadjusted and adjusted models were calculated; the adjusted model included a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the child between surveys, sociodemographic characteristics, and study site. For vaccination intention outcomes, GEE models with multinomial distributions and cumulative logit links were used; the other models assessing perception outcomes used binomial distributions and logit links. All statistical analyses were completed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute); statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 for chi-square tests and nonoverlapping 95% CIs for GEE models. PROTECT was reviewed by CDC and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at University of Arizona and Abt Associates under reliance agreements; the study was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.** 

During July 2021–May 2022, parents provided information on 393 children aged <5 years enrolled in the PROTECT study (Table 1). The majority of children (227; 58%) resided in Arizona, and 92 (23%) had parents in the HEROES-RECOVER cohort (5,6). Median age was 2.8 years (SD = 1.3 year); 189 (48%) were male, 183 (47%) were non-Hispanic White persons, and 110 (28%) were Hispanic persons; 132 (34%) children received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during the study. At baseline, 253 (64.4%) parents reported that they were likely to get their child vaccinated; 76 (19.3%) were unsure, and 39 (9.9%) reported that they were unlikely to vaccinate their child (Table 1). There were statistically significant differences in vaccine intention identified by study site (p<0.001), positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during the study (p = 0.006), percent of household members vaccinated (p = 0.011), and household income (p = 0.003). 

Approximately two thirds of participants (270; 68.7%) completed a 3-month survey and 137 (34.9%) completed a 6-month survey (Table 2) (Figure). Among parents who completed a 3-month survey, 11 (4.1%) changed their vaccination intent from a neutral or negative to positive response after 3 months, although parents overall were 24% less likely to vaccinate (aOR = 0.76) than they were at baseline. Also at 3 months, 30 (11.2%) parents changed their perception of vaccine effectiveness from neutral or negative to positive, although overall, they were 39% less likely to perceive the vaccine as effective (aOR = 0.61). At 3 months after the baseline survey, perception of vaccine safety changed from neutral or negative to positive for 29 (10.9%) parents; however, overall parents were 35% less likely to perceive the vaccine as safe (aOR = 0.65). When asked about perceived trust in government, 28 (10.7%) of parents changed from a negative or neutral to a positive response after 3 months, although they were 51% less likely to report trust in the government compared with baseline (aOR = 0.49). 

Among 137 parents who completed a 6-month survey, 11 (8.1%) changed their perception of vaccine effectiveness from neutral or negative to positive (Table 2); overall parents were 62% less likely to have a positive response (aOR = 0.38) regarding vaccine effectiveness. Eleven (8.4%) parents changed their level of trust in government from negative or neutral to positive, although overall, parents were 49% less likely to have a positive response (aOR = 0.51). In unadjusted models only, vaccination intent and perceptions of vaccine safety were less likely to be neutral or negative at 6 months (OR = 1.66 and OR = 1.82, respectively); after adjusting for receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result before 6-month survey completion, age, sex, race and ethnicity, health insurance, and site, these were no longer statistically significant.","Among parents of 393 children aged <5 years in this analysis, 64% indicated at baseline that they were likely to have their child vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine. During a 3-month observation period, however, parents indicated decreased intention to vaccinate and decreased confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness as well as less trust in the government. Among the subset of participants who were in the study for 6 months, perceptions of vaccine safety, vaccine knowledge, and intent to vaccinate increased, but only in models that were not adjusted for potential confounders including SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period. Perceptions of vaccine effectiveness and trust in government remained neutral or negative after 6 months. 

The PROTECT cohort demonstrated a higher parental intent to vaccinate their young children than did other earlier surveys (2,7). Participants in COVID-19 research might be more likely than nonparticipants to comply with CDC recommendations. However, intention to vaccinate and vaccine confidence decreased over time, even though the vaccines were demonstrated to be safe and effective in older children (8). The decline in confidence is likely the result of multiple factors. For example, the follow-up period occurred at the time of pandemic-related events that might have affected perceptions about COVID-19 vaccines, including conflicting news reports of vaccine availability for this age group (3). In addition, one third of participants received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results during the observation period, which might have reduced parents’ confidence in or perceived need for the COVID-19 vaccine†† or reinforced assumptions of mild illness in children. Finally, news of lower estimates of vaccine effectiveness in older children potentially influenced the decline in vaccine confidence (9) in early 2022. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, follow-up surveys were distributed over 3-month periods, making discerning specific causes of changes in vaccine perception difficult. Second, because the study population is participating in a surveillance and vaccine-effectiveness study and includes frontline workers, vaccine intention might be inflated. Third, the majority of participants are from Arizona, which might not be representative of other states. Finally, not all participants in this ongoing longitudinal cohort study have been enrolled long enough to complete follow-up surveys. 

This study is the first longitudinal analysis of vaccine intention and perceptions among parents of children aged <5 years. During a 3-month observation period, parents reported reduced confidence and intent to vaccinate their child when the vaccine becomes available, although their overall intent is higher than other national published rates (2,7,10). Enhanced efforts to identify and address parental barriers to and increase confidence in COVID-19 vaccination in children aged <5 years are needed, including educating parents about the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in this population.

A COVID-19 vaccine booster dose provides enhanced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19–associated emergency department visits, hospitalization, and death. 

What is added by this report? 

Among 214 million eligible persons aged ≥5 years, approximately one half received a booster dose. Among 55 million eligible persons aged ≥50 years, approximately one third received a second booster dose. Booster and second booster dose coverage rates were lower among the youngest age groups; males; non-Hispanic Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and multiracial persons; residents of rural counties; and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) primary series recipients. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Focused interventions to improve vaccine equity and effectiveness of outreach to populations with low booster and second booster dose coverage should be developed and implemented.

COVID-19 vaccine booster doses provide enhanced protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergency department visits, hospitalization, and death (1–3). As of May 19, 2022, all fully vaccinated persons aged ≥5 years are recommended to receive a booster dose when eligible; selected populations, as determined by age and immunocompromise status, are also eligible for a second booster or an additional dose to complete a primary COVID-19 vaccination series (4). Data on COVID-19 vaccine doses administered during August 13, 2021–August 5, 2022, and submitted to CDC from 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) were analyzed to assess booster and second booster vaccination coverage among eligible populations, by age group, sex, race and ethnicity, urban-rural classification, and the primary series vaccine product received. For this analysis, primary series completion was defined as receipt of 2 mRNA (i.e., mRNA-1273 [Moderna] or BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech]) COVID-19 vaccine doses or 1 Ad26.COV.S (Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) COVID-19 vaccine dose because data were not available to identify immunocompromised persons who might have received an additional primary dose. Among 214.4 million eligible persons aged ≥5 years, 106.3 million (49.6%) received a booster dose, and booster dose coverage increased with age. Booster dose coverage was lowest for children, adolescents, and adults aged 18–39 years; males; non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), and multiracial persons; residents of rural counties; and Janssen primary series recipients. Among 58.8 million eligible first booster dose recipients aged ≥50 years, 20.0 million (34.0%) received a second booster dose. Second booster dose coverage was lowest among persons aged 50–64 years; males; Hispanic, Black, and multiracial persons; residents of rural counties; and Janssen primary series recipients. Interventions focused on improving public health communication and outreach to populations with low booster and second booster dose vaccination coverage should be developed to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines and ensure that all persons can benefit from the increased protection conferred by COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. 

On August 13, 2021, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that moderately or severely immunocompromised persons receive an additional dose to complete a primary series of Moderna (persons aged ≥18 years) or Pfizer-BioNTech (persons aged ≥12 years) COVID-19 vaccine (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120701). On September 24, and October 21, 2021, a COVID-19 booster dose was recommended for selected populations aged ≥18 years,* and then recommended for all persons aged ≥18 years on November 19, 2021. On December 9, 2021, January 5, 2022, and May 19, 2022, booster dose recommendations were expanded to Pfizer-BioNTech recipients aged 16–17, 12–15, and 5–11 years, respectively. In addition, selected populations, including all persons aged ≥50 years and moderately or severely immunocompromised persons aged ≥12 years, became eligible to receive a second COVID-19 booster dose on March 29, 2022. 

Data on COVID-19 vaccine administration in the United States are reported to CDC by jurisdictions, pharmacies, and federal entities.† COVID-19 vaccine doses administered during August 13, 2021–August 5, 2022, among persons aged ≥5 years in 50 states (excluding persons aged <18 years in Idaho)§ and DC, were analyzed to assess booster and second booster dose vaccination coverage by age group, sex, race and ethnicity, urban-rural classification,¶ and the primary series vaccine product received. Booster dose vaccination coverage was calculated among persons who completed a primary series** of Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Janssen COVID-19 vaccine and were eligible to receive a booster dose by the end of the analysis period.†† Persons who received 2 mRNA COVID-19 doses or 1 Janssen COVID-19 dose were defined as having completed a primary series because data to identify persons who might have received an additional primary dose were not available. A booster dose was defined as a homologous or heterologous dose of COVID-19 vaccine administered ≥4 weeks§§ after completion of a primary series. A second booster dose was defined as a homologous or heterologous dose of COVID-19 vaccine administered ≥3 months (mRNA primary series recipients) or ≥2 months (Janssen recipients) after receipt of the first booster dose. 

Information on recipient race and ethnicity was available for 73.6% of the eligible population. Analyses were conducted using SQL Server Management Studio (version 18; Microsoft) and SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Tests for statistical significance were not conducted because these data are reflective of the U.S. population aged ≥5 years¶¶ and were not based on probability population samples. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*** 

As of August 5, 2022, 214.4 million persons aged ≥5 years (68.6% of the U.S. population aged ≥5 years)††† were eligible to receive a booster dose. Among this population, 106.3 million (49.6%) received a booster dose (Table 1). Booster coverage increased with age, ranging from 15.6% among children aged 5–11 years to 69.5% among adults aged ≥65 years. Booster coverage was lower among males (47.3%) than among females (51.9%), and the coverage difference between males and females was largest among persons aged 18–39 years (6 percentage points). Overall, booster coverage varied by race and ethnicity, ranging from 37.3% among Hispanic persons to 58.5% among non-Hispanic Asian persons. When stratified by age group, the lowest booster dose coverage among persons aged 5–39 years was among Black persons (range = 9.8%–27.9%), and among those aged ≥40 years, coverage was lowest among Hispanic (range = 45.4%–64.0%) and multiracial (range = 45.7%–62.7%) persons. Booster dose coverage was lower in persons living in rural counties (micropolitan and noncore) (48.5%) than among urban residents (50.3%), although coverage differences by urban-rural classification were smaller among older adults. Among persons aged ≥18 years, booster coverage among Janssen, Moderna, and Pfizer-BioNTech primary series recipients was 34.8%, 56.3%, and 51.9%, respectively. 

Among 58.8 million persons aged ≥50 years who were eligible to receive a second booster dose, 20.0 million (34.0%) received a second booster by August 5, 2022 (Table 2). Second booster dose coverage increased with age, ranging from 26.1% among persons aged 50–64 years to 41.4% among those aged ≥75 years. Second booster dose coverage was lowest among males, Hispanic and Black persons, persons living in rural counties, and Janssen primary series recipients.","By August 5, 2022, approximately one half of the eligible population aged ≥5 years had received a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose, representing approximately one third (34.0%) of the U.S. population aged ≥5 years. Booster and second booster dose vaccination coverage rates were lowest among the youngest age groups; males; Black, Hispanic, and multiracial persons; residents of rural counties; and Janssen primary series recipients. Some similarities existed between booster dose coverage and primary series coverage trends as of August 21, 2022, with children, adolescents, younger adults aged 18–24 years, males, and Black persons being underrepresented among fully vaccinated persons (5). 

Booster dose coverage was highest among adults aged ≥65 years (69.5%), with smaller coverage differences across sex, race and ethnicity, and urban-rural classification compared with that in adults aged 18–64 years. Among age groups, the lowest booster dose coverage was among children aged 5–11 years (15.6%), followed by that among adolescents aged 12–17 years (33.4%). Children aged 5–11 years were recommended to receive a booster dose most recently, which might partially explain the low coverage in this group. Racial and ethnic disparities in booster dose coverage were largest (≥26 percentage points) among persons aged 12–39 years. Understanding the factors contributing to low booster and second booster dose coverage among Black, Hispanic, and multiracial populations, and designing interventions to address these factors, is crucial to ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination. 

Booster and second booster dose coverage rates among Janssen primary series recipients were lower than those among mRNA vaccine recipients. One possible reason for this is the Janssen 1-dose primary series might have been preferred by persons less likely to receive multiple doses, such as transient populations (e.g., persons experiencing homelessness), persons with limited access to health care, and persons with needle aversion. Booster and second booster dose coverage was lower among residents of rural counties than that among urban residents; lower COVID-19 vaccine acceptance has been observed in rural areas, and rural residents might also experience more barriers to accessing health care than do urban residents (6). Persons living in rural areas were previously found to be less likely to engage in COVID-19 preventive behaviors such as mask wearing (7), which would likely increase the potential benefit provided by a booster dose in this population. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, COVID-19 vaccine booster dose recommendations were released during a 10-month period, and some populations had less time than others to receive a booster dose. Further, changes in COVID-19 variant predominance and case prevalence during this period likely affected booster and second booster dose acceptance among different populations. Second, misclassification of vaccination status might have occurred if linkage among vaccination records in jurisdiction-specific data systems was not possible, if, for example, persons received doses in different jurisdictions. Third, eligibility was determined by age at primary series completion, and a small number of persons who met the minimum eligible age requirement after primary series completion might have been excluded. Fourth, a small proportion of booster and second booster doses might have been misclassified because information on immunocompromise status was not available to identify immunocompromised persons who might have received an additional primary series dose. In addition, misclassification might have occurred due to the definitions for booster and second booster doses, which were designed to include doses administered to immunocompromised persons. However, after receipt of a primary series, approximately 99.0% of persons who received 1 subsequent dose received this dose after the minimum recommended interval for a booster dose; 99.6% of persons who received 2 subsequent doses received the second postprimary series dose after the minimum recommended interval for a second booster dose.§§§ Finally, race or ethnicity was unknown, unable to be reported, or invalid for approximately one quarter of the population, which could bias results. In May 2022, the National Immunization Survey Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM) found no substantial racial and ethnic disparities among fully vaccinated adults (8); however, disparities across race and ethnicity were present in booster dose coverage based on NIS-ACM. 

All fully vaccinated eligible persons aged ≥5 years are recommended to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccine dose, and certain populations, including adults aged ≥50 years, are recommended to receive a second booster dose when eligible (4). Booster doses increase the primary series vaccine effectiveness and strengthen the immune response in children, adolescents, and adults (1–3). Health care providers can educate and encourage all persons to receive a booster dose when they are eligible. Focused interventions should be developed and implemented to improve access to COVID-19 vaccines and ensure the effectiveness of public health communication and outreach to populations with low coverage, which might reduce health disparities.","Corresponding author: Hannah E.

Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine are routinely recommended for adolescents. 

What is added by this report? 

Among adolescents aged 13–17 years in 2021, HPV vaccination coverage (≥1 dose and HPV vaccine up to date) increased. Coverage with ≥1-dose Tdap and ≥1-dose MenACWY remained high. Among age-eligible adolescents, MenACWY booster dose coverage increased. Analyses of the potential COVID-19 pandemic effect among adolescents born in 2008 show a concerning decrease in ≥1 MenACWY and ≥1 Tdap dose coverage. 

What are the implications for public health? 

As more adolescents who were due for routine vaccinations during the pandemic age into the NIS-Teen sample, the full impact of the pandemic can be assessed. Providers should review vaccination records to ensure that adolescents are current with all recommended vaccinations.

CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of persons aged 11–12 years with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY). A second (booster) dose of MenACWY is recommended at age 16 years. On the basis of shared clinical decision-making, adolescents aged 16–23 years may receive a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) series. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for hepatitis A vaccine (HepA); hepatitis B vaccine (HepB); measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR); and varicella vaccine (VAR) for adolescents whose childhood vaccinations are not up to date (1). Although COVID-19 vaccination and influenza vaccination coverage estimates are not presented in this report, vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine and annual influenza vaccination are also recommended by ACIP for adolescents* (2). To estimate vaccination coverage, CDC analyzed data for 18,002 adolescents aged 13–17 years from the 2021 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen).† Coverage with ≥1 dose of Tdap§ (89.6%) and ≥1 dose of MenACWY¶ (89.0%) remained high and stable compared with the previous year. Increases in coverage with the following vaccines occurred from 2020 to 2021: ≥1 dose of HPV** vaccine (from 75.1% to 76.9%); adolescents who were up to date with HPV vaccination (HPV UTD)†† (from 58.6% to 61.7%); and ≥2 MenACWY doses among adolescents aged 17 years (from 54.4% to 60.0%). Coverage with MenACWY, HPV vaccine, and ≥2 HepA doses was lower among adolescents living in nonmetropolitan statistical areas (non-MSAs)§§ than among those living in MSA principal cities. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was assessed by comparing vaccination coverage by age and birth year before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coverage with ≥1 MenACWY dose by age 13 years was 5.1 percentage points lower among adolescents who reached age 13 years during the pandemic (2021) compared with those who reached age 13 in 2019. Coverage with ≥1 Tdap dose by age 12 years was 4.1 percentage points lower among children who reached age 12 years during the pandemic (2020) compared with those who reached age 12 before the pandemic. Coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose by ages 12 and 13 years among children and adolescents who reached age 12 or 13 during the pandemic did not differ from coverage before the pandemic. Many children and adolescents might have missed routine medical care and recommended vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Review of patient vaccination records is important for providers to ensure that children and adolescents are up to date with all recommended vaccinations. 

NIS-Teen is an annual random-digit–dialed telephone survey¶¶ that estimates vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected local areas, and some U.S. territories.*** Parents and guardians of age-eligible adolescents are interviewed about household sociodemographic characteristics and are asked for permission to contact the adolescent’s vaccination providers. Immunization history questionnaires are mailed to vaccination providers with the permission of the parent or guardian to obtain the adolescent’s vaccination record. Vaccination coverage estimates are based on provider-reported vaccination histories and include any vaccines administered before the 2021 NIS-Teen interview date. This report presents vaccination coverage estimates for 18,002 adolescents aged 13–17 years.††† The overall Council of American Survey Research Organizations response rate§§§ was 21.0%; 41.2% of adolescents with completed interviews had adequate provider data. Data were weighted and analyzed to account for the complex survey design. T-tests were used to compare differences in vaccination coverage by survey year (2021 versus 2020) and among sociodemographic groups¶¶¶; differences with p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. The cumulative percentage of adolescents vaccinated by single year of age milestones was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates to account for censoring of vaccination status at ages ≥14 years, stratified by annual birth cohort (2002–2008). To assess potential COVID-19 pandemic effects for ≥1 HPV vaccine, ≥1 MenACWY, and ≥1 Tdap dose, vaccination coverage by age 12 years was compared for children born in 2008 (i.e., those who reached age 12 years in 2020, during the pandemic) to those born in 2007 (i.e., those who reached age 12 years in 2019, before the pandemic); vaccination coverage by age 13 years was compared for adolescents born in 2007 and 2008 (those who reached age 13 years in 2020 and 2021, respectively) to those born in 2006 (those who reached age 13 years in 2019). Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN (version 11; RTI International). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**** 


National Vaccination Coverage 
In 2021, 89.6% of adolescents aged 13–17 years had received ≥1 Tdap dose and 89.0% had received ≥1 MenACWY dose (Figure 1) (Table). Coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose in 2021 was 76.9%, an increase of 1.8 percentage points from 2020; 61.7% were HPV UTD, an increase of 3.1 percentage points. Among those aged 17 years, coverage with ≥2 MenACWY doses was 60.0%, an increase of 5.6 percentage points from 2020; coverage with ≥1 MenB dose was 31.4%. Coverage with ≥2 HepA doses was 85.0%, an increase of 2.9 percentage points from 2020. Coverage remained >90% for ≥2 doses of MMR, ≥3 doses of HepB, and both VAR dose among adolescents without a history of varicella disease.†††† 


Vaccination Coverage by Selected Characteristics 
Compared with adolescents living in MSA principal cities, coverage among those in non-MSAs was 9.0 percentage points lower for ≥1 HPV vaccine dose, 8.8 percentage points lower for HPV UTD, 3.0 percentage points lower for ≥1 MenACWY dose, and 6.9 percentage points lower for ≥2 HepA doses. Among adolescents aged 17 years, coverage with ≥2 MenACWY doses was 11.8 percentage points lower for those living in non-MSAs than for those in MSA principal cities. Disparities between non-MSAs and MSA principal cities were statistically significant for adolescents living at or above the poverty level, but not for those living below the poverty level§§§§ (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120475). Coverage also varied by jurisdiction (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120476), race and ethnicity,¶¶¶¶ and health insurance status.***** 

COVID-19 Pandemic Effects 
Coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose was higher at younger ages for adolescents born in more recent years (Figure 2).††††† Coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose by ages 12 and 13 years among children and adolescents who reached ages 12 and 13 years during the pandemic was similar to coverage among those who reached these milestone ages before the pandemic (Figure 2). Coverage with ≥1 MenACWY dose by age 13 years among adolescents who reached age 13 years during the pandemic was 5.1 percentage points lower (95% CI = −9.8 to −0.4) than among those who reached age 13 years before the pandemic. Coverage with ≥1 Tdap dose by age 12 years was 4.1 percent points lower (95% CI = −8.1 to −0.1) among children who reached age 12 years during the pandemic than among those who reached age 12 years before the pandemic. Tdap coverage by age 13 years among adolescents who reached age 13 years during the pandemic was not statistically different from coverage among those who reached age 13 years before the pandemic. 

","In 2021, coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose, HPV UTD, and ≥2 HepA doses continued to increase among adolescents aged 13–17 years. Coverage with ≥1 Tdap dose, ≥1 MenACWY dose, ≥2 MMR doses, ≥3 HepB doses, and both doses of VAR among adolescents without a history of varicella disease remained high and stable. Coverage with ≥2 MenACWY doses among adolescents aged 17 years was higher in 2021 than in 2020. 

Despite overall progress in vaccination coverage among adolescents, coverage disparities remain, particularly by MSA status. Coverage with MenACWY, HPV vaccine, and ≥2 HepA doses was lower among adolescents living in non-MSAs than among adolescents living in MSA principal cities. These geographic disparities were statistically significant only among adolescents living at or above poverty level. Access to the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program§§§§§ might contribute to higher vaccination coverage and lack of a geographic disparity for adolescents living below the poverty level among those in rural and urban areas. During 2016–2017, adolescents in rural areas were less likely than were those in urban areas to have had an age 11–12-year well-child visit (3), which might result in fewer opportunities to receive a vaccination and fewer opportunities to receive a recommendation for vaccination from a provider. However, differences might also stem from vaccine attitudes and beliefs because coverage was lower among those with incomes above poverty level. Confidence in vaccines has been lower in rural areas than in urban areas for both routine and COVID-19 vaccines (4,5). 

Decreases in coverage with ≥1 MenACWY dose by age 13 years and ≥1 Tdap dose by age 12 years for children and adolescents born in 2008 suggest that disruptions to medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower coverage for these vaccines. Tdap coverage by age 13 years for adolescents born in 2008 was lower than coverage for those born in 2006, but the difference was not statistically significant. Data from eight health systems in the United States evaluating weekly vaccination rates and proportion of children up to date with all age-specific recommended vaccinations also indicated lower coverage during than before the pandemic (6). Large decreases in routine vaccination rates were found for children and adolescents aged 11–13 years during March 15–May 16, 2020, and the proportion of adolescents up to date with vaccinations by age 13 years was 3 percentage points lower in September 2020 (56%) than in September 2019 (59%). As more children who were aged 11–12 years when the COVID-19 pandemic was declared age into the NIS-Teen survey sample, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can be better examined. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the household response rate was 21.0%; 41.4% of completed interviews included adequate provider data. Bias from low response rates might occur if survey participants differ from nonparticipants (7). Second, although estimates are adjusted for household and provider nonresponse and households without a telephone, bias in the estimates might remain. A recent survey error assessment indicated that NIS-Teen estimates might underestimate true coverage, with the largest underestimation for Tdap (−6.3 percentage points).¶¶¶¶¶ Little evidence exists for a change in accuracy of NIS-Teen estimates from 2020 to 2021.****** Finally, this report did not assess the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent vaccination at ages >13 years. An additional analysis of NIS-Teen data indicated no differences in coverage for adolescents aged 14–17 years during the pandemic compared with coverage before the pandemic.†††††† 

Achieving and maintaining high vaccination coverage levels for adolescents will ensure they have protection from serious and sometimes life-threatening vaccine-preventable diseases. To help adolescents catch up on missed vaccinations, health care providers can identify those who have fallen behind on receiving recommended vaccinations and remind families to schedule an appointment. In addition, during every clinical encounter, including those for COVID-19 vaccination, providers can review patients’ vaccination histories and recommend vaccination if needed.

A global monkeypox outbreak is currently primarily affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. 

What is added by this report? 

In a recent survey of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, approximately one half reported reducing their number of sex partners, one-time sexual encounters, and use of dating apps because of the monkeypox outbreak. Receipt of vaccine to protect against monkeypox varied by race, ethnicity, and geography. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

It is essential that public health programs continue to deliver tailored, respectful harm reduction messages that do not create stigma to diverse communities of men who have sex with men. Vaccine programs should prioritize efforts to maximize equitable access.

The first U.S. case of monkeypox during the current outbreak was confirmed on May 17, 2022 (1); on August 4, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency.* To date, most reported monkeypox cases in the United States and globally have occurred among men who reported sexual or close intimate contact with another man during the 3 weeks before symptom onset (2). The multipronged response to monkeypox has included expanding access to monkeypox vaccine and developing messaging† for gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) seeking to reduce their chances for acquiring monkeypox. During August 5–15, 2022, a monkeypox-specific follow-up survey was completed by a convenience sample of 824 MSM who responded to the annual American Men’s Internet Survey (AMIS).§ Overall, 48% of respondents reported reducing their number of sex partners, 50% reported reducing one-time sexual encounters, and 50% reported reducing sex with partners met on dating apps or at sex venues since learning about the monkeypox outbreak. Nearly one in five respondents reported receiving ≥1 dose of vaccine to prevent monkeypox. Receipt of vaccine was highest among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) men (27.1%) and lowest among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) men (11.5%); 17.7% of non-Hispanic White (White) men and 24.2% of men of other race or ethnicity received vaccine. Receipt of vaccine was higher in urban (27.8%) and suburban (14.5%) areas than in other areas (5.7%–7.0%). These data suggest that MSM are taking steps to protect themselves and their partners from monkeypox. It is important that federal, state, and local public health programs continue to deliver tailored, respectful harm reduction messages that do not create stigma to diverse communities of MSM. Vaccine programs should prioritize efforts to maximize equitable access to vaccines to prevent monkeypox. 

AMIS is an annual, cross‐sectional, online behavioral survey of a convenience sample of cisgender men in the United States who report sex with another man during the 12 months preceding the survey (3). During August 5–15, 2022, AMIS 2021 survey participants who agreed to be recontacted were invited to complete a follow-up survey assessing knowledge of and experiences with monkeypox. After providing research consent, participants answered questions about general knowledge, awareness, and concern about monkeypox; personal behavior changes during the past 3 months because of the monkeypox outbreak; and receipt of vaccine to prevent monkeypox infection. The Emory University Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved procedures for the AMIS survey. This activity was also reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶ 

Overall, 2,999 AMIS 2021 participants were invited to participate in the monkeypox survey, and 824 (27.5%) responded and completed all questionnaire sections. Among these respondents, 70.5% were White, and 50.9% were aged <45 years. Most men (90.0%) reported sex with a man during the preceding 3 months (i.e., during the current monkeypox outbreak); 238 (28.9%) reported two or more sex partners during the preceding 14 days. Respondents were from all regions of the United States; (47.8%) lived in urban areas. 

Respondents reported changing sexual behaviors since they learned about the monkeypox outbreak (Table 1). Overall, 47.8% reported reducing their number of sex partners, 49.8% reported reducing one-time sexual encounters, and 49.6% reported reducing sex with partners met on dating apps or at sex venues. In addition, 50.4% reported reducing group sex participation, and 41.9% reported reducing attendance at sex venues or social events with close contact because of the monkeypox outbreak. 

A total of 151 respondents (18.6%) reported receiving ≥1 dose of vaccine to prevent monkeypox (Table 2). Receipt of vaccine was highest among Hispanic men (27.1%) and lowest among Black men (11.5%); 17.7% of White men and 24.2% of men of another race and ethnicity received vaccine. Receipt of vaccine was higher in urban (27.8%) and suburban (14.5%) areas than in medium or small metropolitan (7.0%) or rural (5.7%) areas and was higher in the Northeast (27.8%) and West (21.5%) than in the Midwest (14.9%) or South (13.0%) U.S. Census Regions. 

Receipt of vaccine was more common among respondents reporting two or more partners during the preceding 14 days (30.1%) than among those reporting no partners or one partner (13.9%) and among those reporting engaging in group sex with male partners during the preceding 3 months (31.5%) than among those not engaging in group sex during that time (12.8%). Among 662 persons who had not received monkeypox vaccine, 180 (28.5%) indicated that they had tried to get vaccinated. 

Frequency of receipt of vaccine was similar for persons who reported having received a diagnosis of HIV infection (22.3%) and those whose most recent HIV test was negative (19.0%). Among those who reported not having HIV, a higher proportion of persons taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (31.4%) than those not taking HIV PrEP (7.0%) were vaccinated. When limited to 188 men with two or more partners during the preceding 14 days, vaccination was even more prevalent among those taking HIV PrEP: 46 (38.0%) of 121 respondents taking HIV PrEP reported having received vaccine, compared with nine (13.4%) of 67 who were not taking HIV PrEP. Receipt of vaccine was also more prevalent among men who received testing for another sexually transmitted infection during the preceding 3 months. 

Three (1.7%) participants reported having received a diagnosis of monkeypox, and 91 (11.4%) of 798 who responded to the question reported knowing someone who had received a diagnosis of monkeypox. Although 53.1% reported they were “somewhat concerned” or “very concerned” about monkeypox, 82.3% reported feeling confident that they could protect themselves from monkeypox.","These findings among a convenience sample of men who reported male sexual contact provide early information about the actions that MSM are taking to reduce their risk for acquiring and transmitting Monkeypox virus. These data highlight the importance of health communication in the context of strong community leadership in response to the U.S. monkeypox outbreak. The adoption of prevention strategies reported here aligns with specific harm reduction strategies developed for monkeypox and with broader sexual health information and recommendations for MSM.** A modeling study that assessed the potential effects of reductions in one-time sexual partnerships found that these changes might substantially slow transmission and ultimately reduce the percentage of MSM who acquire monkeypox (4). It is important that federal, state, and local public health programs continue to deliver tailored harm reduction messages to diverse communities of MSM. These messages should be designed to reduce the potential for stigma (5) and build strength and resiliency (6). 

These data also suggest racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination, with particularly low reported vaccination among Black men, who are disproportionately affected by monkeypox (2). In addition, men who were not taking HIV PrEP or who had not received STI testing were less likely to have received vaccine, suggesting opportunities to improve access for persons who are less engaged with routine health care and sexual health services. Equitable vaccine program implementation involves community engagement in program planning and implementation, engaging diverse partners already working with special populations, delivering vaccines through mobile outreach and pop-up events, and diversifying times and locations for vaccine administration.†† 

These survey data suggest important geographic differences in vaccination, with lower reported vaccination receipt in less urban areas and among men in the South and Midwest. This is particularly concerning because the highest number of cases reported to date have been from southern states.§§ Expanding vaccine availability geographically, including diversifying vaccination locations to include nonurban areas, can help ensure that those who need vaccination have access to it. This will be especially important as vaccine availability increases and vaccine strategies expand beyond postexposure prophylaxis to include preexposure vaccination. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, this survey represents a convenience sample of Internet-using cisgender MSM who chose to participate in a survey about monkeypox. This subset of men is older and less racially diverse than the full AMIS sample (7), and persons who were more concerned about monkeypox might have been more likely to complete the survey, which could lead to overestimates of behavior modifications and receipt of vaccine. Additional efforts to collect information from populations disproportionately affected by the current monkeypox outbreak are underway. Second, these data are self-reported and might be subject to social desirability bias. Third, the reported number of partners during the preceding two weeks might not reflect sexual behaviors throughout the entire outbreak (and thus eligibility for expanded postexposure prophylaxis with vaccine), particularly if behaviors changed because of the outbreak or receiving vaccine; ongoing monitoring will be needed to understand persistence or changes in these findings over time. Finally, because the survey did not ask whether respondents had seen harm reduction messaging, these changes cannot be ascribed directly to messaging efforts. 

Addressing inequities in vaccine availability and coverage is an urgent public health priority. However, vaccination alone will not be sufficient to end the current monkeypox outbreak. These findings suggest that MSM are already taking actions to protect their sexual health and making decisions to reduce risk to themselves and their partners. These changes are important to protect MSM from exposure before access to vaccine is possible and after vaccination.¶¶ CDC will continue to work with state and local partners to develop and provide tailored, respectful harm reduction messaging to diverse communities affected by the monkeypox outbreak and to monitor the impact of messaging and prevention strategies, including vaccination.","Corresponding author: Kevin P.

Nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses treated in emergency departments (EDs) are increasing, yet ED surveillance does not capture all overdoses because persons who had a nonfatal opioid-involved overdose often refuse transport by emergency medical services (EMS). 

What is added by this report? 

The rate of nonfatal opioid-involved overdose EMS encounters increased, on average, 4.0% quarterly during January 2018–March 2022, from 98.1 to 179.1 per 10,000 EMS encounters. Rates increased across most sociodemographic and county characteristics. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Monitoring nonfatal opioid-involved overdose trends in EMS data in near real time can help identify communities disproportionately affected by overdose and can guide equitable response and prevention efforts, including increased access to harm reduction services and linkage to care and treatment.

The number of nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses treated by health care providers has risen in the United States; the median number of emergency department (ED) visits for these overdoses was significantly higher during 2020 than during 2019 (1). ED visit data can underestimate nonfatal opioid-involved overdose incidence because, increasingly, persons experiencing a nonfatal opioid overdose are refusing transport to EDs by emergency medical services (EMS) (2). A study in Kentucky found that during a 6-month period, 19.8% of persons treated by EMS for an opioid overdose refused transport to an ED (2). Thus, EMS encounter data involving suspected nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses complement ED data and also allow for near real-time analysis (3). This report describes trends in rates of EMS encounters for nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses per 10,000 total EMS encounters (rates) by selected patient- and county-level characteristics during January 2018–March 2022 in 491 counties from 21 states using data from biospatial, Inc.* During this period, the nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rate increased, on average, 4.0% quarterly. Rates increased for both sexes and for most age groups. Rates were highest among non-Hispanic White (White) and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) persons, and increases were largest among non-Hispanic Black (Black), followed by Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. Rates increased in both urban and rural counties and for all quartiles of county-level characteristics (i.e., unemployment, education, and uninsured), except in counties with the lowest percentage of uninsured persons. Rates were highest and rate increases were largest in urban counties and counties with higher unemployment rates. This analysis of nonfatal opioid-involved overdose trends in EMS data highlights the utility of these data and the importance of addressing inequities that contribute to disproportionate overdose risk, such as through focused outreach to racial and ethnic minority groups, who disproportionately experience these inequities, and communities with higher levels of unemployment. EMS providers are in a unique position to engage in postoverdose response protocols and promote evidence-based overdose education and facilitate linkage to care and harm reduction services.†,§ 

EMS data collected by biospatial, Inc. from 491 counties in 21 states¶ with consistent data coverage** were analyzed by quarter during January 2018–March 2022. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) standard guidance for querying EMS data for nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses was applied. The CSTE EMS Nonfatal Opioid Overdose Standard Guidance (published May 2022) queries coded data elements (provider’s primary and secondary impression, primary and other associated symptoms, medication administered, and response to medication) and a free text field (patient care report narrative) to identify suspected nonfatal opioid-involved overdose encounters.†† Encounters were included if the type of service requested was an emergency response and excluded if a fatal encounter was indicated, or if the encounter was cancelled or was an assist to the primary responding unit.§§

Joinpoint regression (version 4.9; National Cancer Institute) was used to measure the average quarterly percent change (AQPC) for the entire study period and quarterly percent change for each trend segment; the permutation model selection method was used, and the maximum number of joinpoints allowed was three. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§§ 

The rate of nonfatal opioid-involved overdose EMS encounters increased, on average, 4.0% per quarter during January 2018–March 2022, increasing from 98.1 per 10,000 EMS encounters during Quarter 1 (Q1)¶¶¶ 2018 to 179.1 during Q1 2022 (Table). Nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates increased for most strata; the most common inflection points were Quarter 3 (Q3) 2019 and Quarter 2 (Q2) 2020 (Figure 1) (Figure 2). Beginning in Q3 2020, overall nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates stabilized after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 


Patient-Level Characteristics 
Nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates were highest among adults aged 25–34 years and lowest among children and adolescents aged 0–14 years (Figure 1). AQPCs for the entire study period were positive in all age groups except 15–24 years (range = 3.2%–5.8%). Rates were higher in males than in females, and the disparity widened over time (AQPC for males, 4.7%; for females, 3.1%) (Figure 1). Rates were highest among White and NH/OPI persons and lowest among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) persons (Figure 1). Rates increased significantly among all racial and ethnic groups except NH/OPI persons; among groups with an increase, AQPCs ranged from 3.1% to 7.4%. Rates increased, on average, 3.4% quarterly among White persons, whereas increases were substantially higher among Black (7.4%) and Hispanic persons (5.7%). Rates were higher among persons transported by EMS than among those not transported by EMS (Figure 1); however, increases were larger among those not transported by EMS (AQPC for those not transported, 7.1%; for those transported, 3.9%). 


County-Level Characteristics 
Nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates were higher in counties with higher unemployment (Figure 2); rates increased faster in counties with higher unemployment, with the AQPC for the entire period ranging from 2.1% in counties in the lowest quartile of unemployment to 5.9% in counties in the highest quartile. Rates were lowest in counties with the smallest proportion of high school graduates and highest among counties with the next smallest proportion (Figure 2). The AQPC for the entire study period was positive for all education quartiles (range = 3.1%–5.0%). AQPCs were positive (range = 3.3%–5.5%) for all quartiles of uninsured except the lowest quartile; rate increases were largest for the third quartile, which had the lowest rate in Q1 2018 and the highest rate in Q1 2022, more than doubling from 88.1 to 215.8 per 10,000 EMS encounters (Figure 2). Rates were higher in urban than in rural counties, and the disparity increased over time (AQPC for urban counties, 4.2%; for rural counties, 2.8%) (Figure 2).","This report highlights several findings: 1) rates of nonfatal opioid-involved overdose EMS encounters per 10,000 total EMS encounters increased steadily from 2018 through the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates increased for both sexes, all age groups except persons aged 15–24 years, and all racial and ethnic groups except NH/OPI; 3) nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates increased among all quartiles of county-level characteristics, except for counties with the lowest percentage of uninsured persons; and 4) higher nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates and rate increases were observed in urban counties and in counties with higher unemployment rates. 

Increases in nonfatal opioid-involved overdose EMS encounters through Q3 2020 are consistent with increases in nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses treated in EDs (1) and synthetic opioid-involved overdose deaths.**** Nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates in this study remained stable during Q3 2020–Q1 2022, which is consistent with opioid-involved overdose ED visits in CDC’s Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology system.†††† However, this finding is unlike those for mortality data, which have demonstrated increases in opioid-involved overdose deaths during this period. Further exploration into the types of opioids (e.g., fentanyl, heroin, and prescribed opioids) contributing to overdoses and the shifting drug supply will assist in better interpretation of these differences. 

The increase in nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates for most demographic groups is similar to findings from ED data (4). Although rates were highest among White and NH/OPI persons, rate increases were largest among Black, followed by Hispanic persons. According to a recent study, Black persons experienced the largest increase in fatal all-drug overdoses during 2019–2020 (5). Structural barriers, mistrust in the health care system, and other disparities that contribute to overdose risk underscore the need to address inequities, particularly among minority populations, as part of a comprehensive response to the U.S. drug overdose crisis (5). 

This report highlights community characteristics that are associated with higher nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates, such as county-level unemployment. This finding is consistent with a systematic review that reported that recessions and unemployment increased psychological stress and subsequent illegal drug use (6,7). Counties with the lowest percentage of uninsured persons represented the only quartile without a significant increase in the rate of nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses. A previous study found that drug overdose mortality was elevated in U.S. Census Bureau tracts with higher rates of uninsured persons (8); however, in the current analysis, the quartile with the second highest percentage of uninsured persons had the highest rate and largest overall rate increase in nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses. Persons who are uninsured might be less likely to use EMS after an overdose; a study in Wisconsin found that Medicaid expansion resulted in an increase in the share of opioid-related ED visits covered by Medicaid among men aged 19–49 and women aged 19–29 years (9). In contrast to previous research reporting a higher rate of nonfatal opioid-involved overdose ED discharges in rural areas with lower levels of educational attainment (10), rates in the current analysis were lowest in counties with the smallest proportions of high school graduates. This divergent finding might be because of moderation by urbanicity or differences between ED discharge and EMS data (10). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, analyses are not nationally representative; therefore, the results cannot be generalized. Second, there are no toxicology results in EMS records to confirm the substance involved in suspected overdoses; however, EMS providers are trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose so that they can administer appropriate treatment.§§§§ Third, analyses were not able to identify reasons a person might or might not have been transported by EMS after an encounter. It is possible persons who were transported were more likely to be in critical condition (e.g., unconscious) compared with those not transported, and nontransport could have been because of factors other than refusal (e.g., hospitals were at capacity). Fourth, despite only including counties with consistent data coverage, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, total EMS encounters decreased by 12.6% in Q2 2020 compared with the previous quarter, and nonfatal opioid-involved EMS encounters increased 15.2%; thus, nonfatal opioid-involved overdose rates might be inflated during this time. Finally, quality and completeness of EMS data might vary by period, reporting agency, and location. 

These findings illustrate the utility of EMS data to monitor nonfatal opioid-involved overdose trends, especially given past research findings indicating that persons are increasingly refusing EMS transport to EDs after an overdose (2). A study in Kentucky found that during January 14‒April 26, 2020, 19.8% of patients treated by EMS for an opioid overdose refused transport to an ED, increasing from 16.4% before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to 22.4% after the onset (2). This analysis of nonfatal opioid-involved overdose trends highlights the need for increased access to services (e.g., harm reduction) among all populations, and also identifies characteristics of communities that are disproportionately affected by overdoses, such as those with higher unemployment rates. These data can guide public health efforts to ensure implementation of equitable prevention and response initiatives; for example, counties with higher unemployment rates might benefit from increased access to harm reduction services (e.g., naloxone and fentanyl test strip distribution), treatment (e.g., medications for opioid use disorder¶¶¶¶), and behavioral health services. Systems of care, which include EMS, mobile-integrated health, and community paramedicine, could collectively deploy to improve access to treatment and promote harm reduction strategies. For example, the Studying the PhilAdelphia Resilience Project as a Response to Overdose (SPARRow) program has staff members who accompany ambulances responding to overdoses and deliver harm reduction and care linkage to persons who refuse hospital transport.***** EMS data can also improve understanding of prehospital trends in nonfatal opioid-involved overdoses in near real time to guide tailored public health response and prevention efforts.`","Corresponding author: Shannon M.

The 2022 monkeypox outbreak is associated with sexual and intimate contact. Survey data suggest that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), who have been disproportionately affected, are reducing one-time partnerships. 

What is added by this report? 

Modeling of sexual infection transmission between men indicates that one-time partnerships, which account for 3% of daily sexual partnerships and 16% of daily sex acts, account for approximately 50% of daily Monkeypox virus (MPXV) transmission. A 40% reduction in one-time partnerships might delay the spread of monkeypox and reduce the percentage of persons infected by 20% to 31%. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Reductions in one-time partnerships, already being reported by MSM, might significantly reduce MPXV transmission.

Transmission of Monkeypox virus (MPXV) during the 2022 multinational monkeypox outbreak has been associated with close contact, primarily sexual behavior, between men (1). Survey data suggest that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) have taken steps to protect themselves and their partners from monkeypox, including reducing one-time sexual partnerships (2). CDC simulated dynamic network models representing the sexual behavior between MSM. Men with more than one partner in the preceding 3 weeks had 1.8–6.9 times the risk for acquiring monkeypox as did men with only one partner. Although one-time partnerships represented <3% of the total daily partnerships and 16% of the sex between men on any given day, they accounted for approximately 50% of MPXV transmission. In this model, a 40% decrease in one-time partnerships yielded a 20%–31% reduction in the percentage of MSM infected and a delay in the spread of the outbreak. A decrease in one-time partnerships not only decreased the final percentage of MSM infected, but it also increased the number of days needed to reach a given level of infection in the population, allowing more time for vaccination efforts to reach susceptible persons. If decreasing one-time partnerships were combined with additional mitigation measures such as vaccination or shorter time from symptom onset to testing and treatment, this effect would be higher. Reductions in one-time partnerships, a change in behavior already being reported by MSM, might significantly reduce MPXV transmission. 

CDC adapted previously developed models of sexual infection transmission used to study HIV and gonorrhea transmission in the United States* (3,4); this framework has also been used to study MPXV spread in Belgium (5) (Supplementary Box 1; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120605). In this dynamic network modeling framework, men may have zero or one main partnership at a time, assumed to last 477 days on average, as well as zero, one, or two casual partnerships at a time, assumed to last 166 days on average. Men may also form one-time partnerships that last 1 day, meant to mimic a single sexual encounter that is not repeated. A man could possibly have main, casual, and one-time partnerships concurrently. The model includes six strata of sexual activity, which differ in their rate of one-time partnership formation (Supplementary Box 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120606). These partnership strata were informed by data collected during 2016–2019 from MSM in Atlanta, Georgia, who reported the number, type, and duration of their current sexual partnerships (3,4,6). 

MPXV natural history and MSM care-seeking behaviors were based on previous publications, and metrics observed during the current outbreak response when available (7) (Supplementary Box 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120606). Because of uncertainty about how widely MPXV might spread among MSM, two scenarios in which 10 highly active cases were introduced to a population of 10,000 MSM were simulated, representing lower and higher transmission, by adjusting the transmission probability per act, so that MPXV would eventually infect approximately 15% (lower transmission) and 25% (higher transmission) of MSM. Within each transmission scenario, the model estimated the final individual risk for acquiring monkeypox within each of the six sexual activity strata. The model also summarized the proportion of MPXV transmission that occurred via each partnership type. Finally, the reduction in the final proportion of MSM infected was estimated at baseline and under a scenario in which MSM decreased their one-time partnering by 40% 2.5 months after MPXV entered the population, which is similar to recent survey results (2). All simulations were conducted in R (version 4.2.0; R Foundation) using the EpiModel package (8). 

MSM with more than one partner in the previous 3 weeks had 1.8–6.9 times the risk for acquiring monkeypox compared with those who only had one partner in the past 3 weeks, depending on the transmission scenario (Table). The higher transmission scenario resulted in larger differences in risk between men in higher and lower activity strata. For example, in the lower transmission scenario the men in the highest activity stratum had 3.6 times the risk for acquiring monkeypox compared with men who only had one partner in the past 3 weeks; in the higher transmission scenario these men had nearly seven times the risk for acquiring monkeypox. Activity strata with an average of fewer than one partner in the past 3 weeks led to decreased risk for acquiring monkeypox. 

Modeled one-time partnerships had a disproportionate effect on transmission (Figure 1). Although one-time partnerships represented 3% of the total daily partnerships and 16% of the sexual contacts on any given day in the models, these partnerships accounted for 46%–54% of MPXV transmission, depending on the transmission scenario. In the lower transmission scenario, 54.0% of transmission occurred through one-time, 33.2% through casual, and 12.9% through main partnerships over the course of the outbreak. In the higher transmission scenario, 45.6% of transmission occurred through one-time, 38.8% through casual, and 15.6% through main partnerships over the course of the outbreak. In both lower and higher transmission scenarios, casual partnerships played a larger role in transmission than did main partnerships. 

The model predicted that a 40% decrease in one-time partnerships would result in a 20%–31% reduction in the final percentage of MSM infected, depending on the transmission scenario (Figure 2), with larger impact in the lower transmission scenario. This impact could be stronger if combined with additional mitigation measures including vaccination or shorter time from symptom onset to testing and treatment. A decrease in one-time partnerships not only decreased the final percentage of MSM infected, but it also increased the number of days needed to reach a given level of infection in the population, allowing more time for vaccination efforts to reach susceptible persons. For example, reductions in one-time partnerships delayed the timing of 10% cumulative infection by approximately 150 days. Decreased one-time partnerships also led to fewer MSM being infected at any given time. 

","This analysis illustrates that risk for MPXV acquisition varies widely among MSM according to the number of sexual partners a person has. In addition, one-time sexual partnerships are important contributors to the spread of MPXV through a sexual network. The model predicts that reductions in the number of one-time partnerships at a level already reported by MSM (2) might result in reductions in the final proportion of MSM infected and a slower-developing outbreak that would ultimately lead to fewer MSM infected at any given time. These changes might allow for additional time for other prevention measures, such as vaccination, to be more widely implemented and disseminated and reduce the impact on health care systems. 

Although the importance of number of partners has been well established previously (9), the importance of one-time partnerships isn’t as widely understood. Having a large number of partners, as is facilitated by having many one-time partnerships, results in broad connectivity in a sexual network. This increases transmission of all sexually transmitted infections but is particularly important for an infection like monkeypox, which has a short, symptomatic contagious period. 

The findings show that changes already being reported by MSM (2) can have important implications for the trajectory of the monkeypox outbreak. Current vaccination efforts are challenged by the speed with which the outbreak is spreading: the quicker the outbreak spreads, the faster persons become infected, resulting in insufficient time for many men who are susceptible and at risk to receive a vaccine. Because current vaccine supply is limited, measures that might delay the spread of MPXV, such as reduction in one-time partnerships, could be critical for broadening vaccine coverage and lowering the cumulative infection rate. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, data on MPXV transmission needed to develop these types of models are currently limited. The model included scenarios reflecting a lower and higher transmission potential of MPXV; however, the actual transmission potential of this outbreak might be outside the bounds considered. If MPXV were less intensely transmitted, a larger difference in infection risk between the highest and lowest activity strata and a larger impact of behavioral change would be anticipated. If MPXV were more intensely transmitted, a smaller difference in infection risk between the highest and lowest activity strata and a smaller impact of behavioral change would be anticipated. Second, superspreading events are not explicitly modeled. However, because persons in the highest activity stratum have approximately 100 partners per year, some of these one-time partnerships are occurring on the same day, which might adequately approximate a superspreading event. However, the model does not include specific events on a given date. Third, contact tracing is not modeled. Although contact tracing could help reduce infection levels, the exclusion of this mechanism is unlikely to change inferences related to number of partners or one-time partnerships. Fourth, regular reintroductions of MPXV infections are also not modeled. Ignoring regular importation (or exportation) of infections is also unlikely to affect inferences. Finally, the data used to characterize the sexual partnering behavior of MSM were collected among MSM aged <40 years at venues such as bars, bookstores, and other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender–friendly places, and the data might not be representative of all MSM and might have oversampled MSM with more frequent sexual activity. 

In the current outbreak, MPXV has been transmitted predominantly through close contact associated with sexual activity. Therefore, identifying factors that put persons at increased risk for acquiring and transmitting infection is critical to understanding transmission and tailoring mitigation strategies and control measures. These models show that personal decisions and public health interventions around one-time partnerships can have a substantial impact on reducing MPXV transmission. Changes in number of sex partners, and particularly changes in one-time partnerships, which are already being reported by MSM (2), have the potential to delay the spread of the outbreak. This could allow vaccination and implementation of other mitigation efforts to reach populations at high risk before they have been exposed to MPXV, and ultimately reduce MPXV transmission.","Corresponding author: Thomas L.

During 2015–2019, three rabid dogs were imported into the United States from Egypt, where DMRVV is endemic.

What is added by this report?

Consultation with subject matter experts enabled CDC to develop a risk mitigation strategy that permitted 296 dogs to be imported from Egypt during May 10, 2019–December 31, 2020, and reduced the risk for rabid dog importations.

What are the implications for public health practice?

The risk mitigation strategy improved CDC’s ability to ensure that imported dogs posed no public health risk in the United States. This strategy could be used to guide future policy decisions regarding dog importations.

Dog-maintained rabies virus variant (DMRVV) was eliminated in the United States in 2007.

CDC developed a risk mitigation strategy, in consultation with a diverse group of subject matter experts, that permitted 296 dogs to be imported from Egypt during May 10, 2019–December 31, 2020, minimizing the risk for future rabid dog importations. The broadly vetted risk mitigation strategy, which included serologic testing for rabies antibody titer, improved CDC’s ability to ensure that imported dogs from Egypt posed no public health risk in the United States. This strategy could be used to guide future policy decisions regarding dog importations. 

Rabies is responsible for an estimated 59,000 human deaths annually worldwide; 98% of these deaths are attributed to bites from rabid dogs (1). Although numerous variants of the rabies virus exist, DMRVV is of greatest concern because of its global presence in unvaccinated dog populations (1). The endemicity of DMRVV in approximately 110 countries creates a risk that DMRVV could be reintroduced into the United States (2). Rabies virus is usually transmitted through saliva from the bite or scratch of an infected animal (3). The incubation period in dogs and humans is variable, but most dogs infected with the rabies virus begin to show clinical signs of disease within 1–3 months of exposure (4). Rabies is nearly 100% fatal in both humans and animals after clinical signs appear. However, routine rabies vaccination in dogs is nearly 100% effective in preventing rabies infection. Hence, the United States requires that all dogs from rabies endemic countries be vaccinated against rabies before importation. 

Since 2015, three dogs with confirmed rabies have been exported from Egypt into the United States (5–7). Molecular characterization confirmed that the DMRVV known to circulate in Egypt was present in each dog, suggesting that the dogs were infected with DMRVV in Egypt before entering the United States. The repeated export of rabid dogs from Egypt in 2015, 2017, and 2019 suggests that challenges might exist with canine rabies control within the country; these challenges might include poor vaccine quality, improper vaccine storage or administration, inaccurate record keeping, and general lack of oversight from veterinary authorities within the country. With each instance of DMRVV importation into the United States, many persons and animals receive postexposure prophylaxis and undergo monitoring and assessment by their state or local health departments, resulting in costs of ≥$200,000 per event (8). 

As a result of the public health threat posed by dogs imported from Egypt, a suspension of dogs entering the United States from Egypt was issued on May 10, 2019*. Recognizing that returning citizens, including military service members, might be importing their dogs into the United States, CDC developed and implemented a risk mitigation strategy to minimize the likelihood of importing DMRVV from Egypt during the suspension. 

Data for the current report were collected through the CDC Application for Permission to Import A Dog Inadequately Immunized Against Rabies — Single Entry forms†. Applications were uploaded and stored in CDC’s Quarantine Activity Reporting System (QARS), a secure database that records CDC’s border public health activities, including actions taken for CDC-regulated importations. Application data were deidentified for analysis before being extracted from QARS for analysis. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§ 

Dogs were defined as inadequately immunized if they received a rabies vaccine not licensed for use in dogs in the United States, or if they were vaccinated by a veterinarian not state-licensed in the United States, because this is considered unverifiable documentation. Before importation, owners of inadequately vaccinated dogs were required to submit rabies antibody serologic test results from a laboratory approved by the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). If serologic test results were >0.5 IU/mL, CDC issued a conditional import permit, which required revaccination with a rabies vaccine licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture within 10 days of arrival in the United States. Under the risk mitigation strategy, dogs entering the United States were required to be adequately protected against rabies and comply with recommendations outlined in the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians Rabies Compendium (7) through the conditional permit process, which required dogs to be revaccinated upon arrival. This strategy was developed through consultation with rabies subject matter experts from federal and state agencies, CDC policy experts, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the General Counsel. 

To prevent the import of rabid dogs into the United States, a working group consisting of state and federal partners, animal importation experts, and rabies subject matter experts was convened to discuss processes to reduce the possibility of DMRVV importation from countries with endemic DMRVV, in consultation with CDC policy experts and HHS Office of the General Counsel. The group reviewed rabies epidemiologic data from multiple sources and compared current U.S. dog importation requirements with those of other DMRVV-free countries. The group discussed critical data elements to include in the risk mitigation algorithm (Figure). The meetings also provided an opportunity for federal and state partners to voice their concerns and propose long-term solutions to address the heightened possibility of DMRVV importation from Egypt. Consultations with rabies and animal importation experts from the European Union, the Pan American Health Organization, and the Veterinary Border Inspection Office, Norwegian Food Safety Authority also contributed to the working group’s deliberations. 

Consensus was achieved on the following processes: persons wishing to import a dog from Egypt were required to apply for and receive a CDC dog importation permit; in addition eligible owners or importers working on behalf of an owner were required to submit 1) CDC Application for Permission to Import a Dog Inadequately Immunized Against Rabies form; 2) proof of a current, valid rabies vaccination certificate;¶ 3) a rabies serologic test result of >0.5 IU/mL from a WOAH-approved laboratory when the dog was considered to be inadequately immunized against rabies; 4) evidence that the dog was aged ≥4 months and eligible for entry into the United States;** 5) verifiable identification information (microchip); and 6) documentation of the owner’s employment, university, or other evidence indicating relocation or return to the United States. 

During May 2019–December 2020, permits for the importation of 296 dogs from Egypt into the United States were issued (Table 1). None of the 296 dogs developed rabies after importation. Among the applicants, 42% were short-term travelers returning to the United States after vacationing in Egypt and 50.0% had dogs that had been vaccinated outside the United States (Table 2). The average processing time for permit requests was 7.9 days for U.S.-vaccinated dogs and 10.4 days for foreign-vaccinated dogs. 

","The goals of the risk mitigation strategy were to maximize public health protection, reduce the possibility of DMRVV importation events, minimize the difficulties that importers might face when attempting to import a dog, align with state vaccination requirements, and reduce the costs faced by state government health agencies. Data from this analysis indicated that 50% of dogs imported from Egypt during May 2019–December 2020 were vaccinated outside the United States and might have posed a public health risk if CDC had not required the importers to submit pre-arrival rabies serologic test results and agree to postarrival revaccination of their dogs. The risk mitigation strategy improved CDC’s ability to ensure that these dogs posed no public health risk in the United States. After attempts to import ineligible dogs during the COVID-19 pandemic, CDC temporarily suspended the entry of dogs into the United States from all countries considered high-risk for canine rabies on July 14, 2021.†† This suspension used the risk mitigation strategy described in this report as a basis for the temporary CDC dog importation suspension issued in 2021, which uses a combination of import permits, pre-arrival serologic tests, postarrival revaccination, and quarantine (only available during the 2021 suspension). 

The reintroduction of DMRVV in Texas in the 1980s led to a large-scale elimination effort by federal and state public health partners for decades. During that time, DMRVV was associated with the death of two persons (9) and approximately $25 million in elimination costs (10). Although DMRVV has been eliminated from the United States since 2007, DMRVV has a strong potential to adapt to new hosts, including novel reservoir species (1). Potential outcomes of importing rabid dogs include the reintroduction and sustained transmission of DMRVV among domestic animals and wildlife, high costs to eliminate DMRVV from animal populations, and the infection of humans and animals resulting in death. The risk mitigation strategy developed during the 2019–2020 suspension of dogs imported from Egypt allowed for the safe entry of some dogs and prevented transmission of rabies by minimizing the likelihood of introducing DMRVV from Egypt during that period. This strategy could be used to guide future policy decisions regarding dog importations.","Corresponding author: Michelle Latzer, mlatzer@cdc.gov, 404-498-3062.","Suggested citation for this article: Latzer M, Pieracci EG, Altenburger A, Stauffer KE, Brown CM.

On July 28, 2021, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) notified the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) of seven wildland firefighters from two crews who had respiratory illness. Crew A (19 members) and crew B (21 members) had worked on wildfires in late June 2021 near the Tehachapi Mountains, a California region with historically high coccidioidomycosis incidence.* Among the seven symptomatic firefighters, three cases of coccidioidomycosis were laboratory-confirmed; two patients developed severe disease. All three firefighters with confirmed coccidioidomycosis reported working in dusty conditions without wearing respiratory protection. Because no vaccine for coccidioidomycosis currently exists, correct use of respiratory protection is important for preventing coccidioidomycosis, especially in regions with high disease incidence.

During July 17–August 4, 2021, the seven ill firefighters each visited an emergency department two or three times with cough, chest pain, or shortness of breath; all received negative test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Three of the seven firefighters were hospitalized, had serologic test results that were positive for coccidioidomycosis, and were treated with antifungal medication. CDPH interviewed these three patients and reviewed their medical records. Coccidioidomycosis serologic test results for the other four firefighters were negative; however, repeat serology is often suggested if coccidioidomycosis is suspected.† Two of these four were retested and results remained negative and were managed in ambulatory clinics, and two were lost to follow-up. All confirmed cases occurred in patients who worked on crew B, resulting in an attack rate for confirmed cases of 14.3% (three of 21).

The three confirmed cases occurred in men aged 25–34 years, none of whom had any remarkable past medical history. Two patients reported Hispanic or Latino race or ethnicity, and one did not report race or ethnicity. Length of hospital stay ranged from 8 to 17 days. All three patients were treated with the antifungal fluconazole; interval from illness onset to commencement of treatment ranged from 10 to 12 days.

Illness onset and work history dates suggested that Coccidioides exposure likely occurred during a 3-day fire near the Tehachapi Mountains. All three patients reported digging trenches and “mopping up” the fire, which included digging and moving soil, with heavy dust exposure and without respiratory protection. All had been fit-tested for a respirator and reported having been trained to minimize dust exposure.

Coccidioidomycosis outbreaks have been reported among wildland firefighters in California, where job-related soil and dust exposure in areas with coccidioidomycosis increases the risk for infection (1,2). The fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis is endemic in the soil in the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and California, and in parts of Mexico and Central and South America§; endemicity is also likely expanding (3). Use of respiratory protection is challenging in wildland firefighting because of concerns about respirator flammability and compatibility with other equipment, as well as the hot, strenuous nature of the emergency-related work. Despite these challenges, fire agencies could consider evaluating the feasibility of respirator use under specific conditions (e.g., during dust-generating activities away from active burning) and adopt policies accordingly.

Early recognition of coccidioidomycosis and disease management are essential to mitigating severity (4). CDPH has previously recommended that all California wildland firefighters receive coccidioidomycosis training regarding exposure risks, prevention, and when to seek care¶ (2); CAL FIRE policy is to conduct this training at the beginning of each fire season. Based on findings of this investigation, CDPH recommends safety briefings on coccidioidomycosis prevention, such as use of respirator protection or wetting of soil before disturbance, before deployment to, and return from, possible areas with endemic Coccidioides spp. During this outbreak, CAL FIRE was proactive in recommending coccidioidomycosis testing; cases were diagnosed within 12 days, compared with a median of 55 days from illness onset to diagnosis reported in an Arizona study (5). California health care providers should ask patients with respiratory illness about work location, high-risk occupations, and exposure to soil disturbance. Providers should also consider that signs and symptoms of coccidioidomycosis might be similar to those of COVID-19 to avoid unnecessary delays in diagnosis. As frequency of coccidioidomycosis and wildfires increase in California, exploration of protective equipment and additional training are needed to better protect wildland firefighters (3).

The two persons with monkeypox (patients A and B) lived together without other housemates. Both persons experienced prodromal symptoms (e.g., fatigue and body aches). Eight days after symptom onset, patient A experienced penile lesions; lesions spread to the lips, hands, legs, chest, and scalp by day 10. Patient B experienced prodromal symptoms 8 days after illness onset of patient A; patient B experienced a lesion on the foot which spread to the leg and finger by day 11. Although both patients had lesions in multiple anatomic areas, the overall number of lesions was small, and lesions varied in presentation from “pimple-like” or ulcerated, to characteristically well-circumscribed and centrally umbilicated. Both patients had mild illness. The time from symptom onset to resolution was approximately 30 days for patient A and approximately 22 days for patient B. 

To assess the presence and degree of surface contamination of household objects contacted by monkeypox patients, UDHHS swabbed objects in the home of the patients. The patients identified high-contact objects and surfaces for sampling; the patients also described cleaning and disinfection activities performed within the home during their illness and locations within the home where they spent substantial amounts of time while ill. The patients had isolated at home for 20 days before their home was entered for sampling. The patients were still symptomatic at the time UDHHS collected specimens from their home. The temperature in the two-story home ranged from 69°F (20.6°C) to 75°F (23.9°C) during their period of isolation. CDC monkeypox-specific cleaning and decontamination guidance (1) was shared with the occupants at the time the home surfaces were swabbed. 

UDHHS personnel entered the residence discreetly wearing recommended personal protective equipment (2). They performed targeted environmental sampling using published methods (3). Specimens were obtained from 30 objects in nine areas of the home and were transported to the Utah Public Health Laboratory for shipment to CDC where they were processed and tested with both nonvariola Orthopoxvirus and West African Monkeypox virus–specific real-time PCR assays (4,5). Viral culture was only pursued if the qualitative PCR result was positive.* This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.† 

Among the 30 specimens, 21 (70%) yielded positive real-time PCR results, including those from all three porous items (i.e., cloth furniture and blankets), 17 of 25 (68%) nonporous surfaces (e.g., handles and switches), and one of two mixed surface types (i.e., chair) (Table). No specimen yielded a positive viral culture result. During the period of isolation both residents of the home reported showering once or twice each day, performing hand hygiene approximately 10 times daily, laundering bedding and clothing weekly, and performing routine household cleaning (e.g., mopping and daily use of a multisurface spray on most high-contact surfaces). The cleaning spray used was not listed on the Environmental Protection Agency’s List of Disinfectants for Emerging Viral Pathogens.§ 

Monkeypox virus DNA was detected from many objects and surfaces sampled indicating that some level of contamination occurred in the household environment. However, the inability to detect viable virus suggests that virus viability might have decayed over time or through chemical or environmental inactivation. Although both patients were symptomatic and isolated in their home for >3 weeks, their cleaning and disinfection practices during this period might have limited the level of contamination within the household. These data are limited, and additional studies are needed to assess the presence and degree of surface contamination and investigate the potential for indirect transmission of Monkeypox virus in household environments. 

Monkeypox virus primarily spreads through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact with the rash, scabs, lesions, body fluids, or respiratory secretions of a person with monkeypox; transmission via contaminated objects or surfaces (i.e., fomites) is also possible.¶ Persons living in or visiting the home of someone with monkeypox should follow appropriate precautions against indirect exposure and transmission by wearing a well-fitting mask, avoiding touching possibly contaminated surfaces, maintaining appropriate hand hygiene, avoiding sharing eating utensils, clothing, bedding, or towels, and following home disinfection recommendations.**,††",N/A,"Corresponding author: Jack A.

Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions infected with SARS-CoV-2 have increased risks for hospitalization. 

What is added by this report? 

Increased hospitalization rates among adults aged ≥65 years compared with rates among younger adults were most pronounced during the Omicron BA.2–predominant period. Among hospitalized nonpregnant patients, 44.1% had received primary vaccination and ≥1 booster or additional dose. Hospitalization rates among unvaccinated adults were approximately triple those of vaccinated adults. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Adults should stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including booster doses. Multiple nonpharmaceutical and medical prevention measures should be used to protect persons at high risk for severe SARS-CoV-2, regardless of vaccination status.

Beginning the week of March 20–26, 2022, the Omicron BA.2 variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, became the predominant circulating variant in the United States, accounting for >50% of sequenced isolates.* Data from the COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) were analyzed to describe recent COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates among adults aged ≥18 years during the period coinciding with BA.2 predominance (BA.2 period [Omicron BA.2 and BA.2.12.1; March 20–May 31, 2022]). Weekly hospitalization rates (hospitalizations per 100,000 population) among adults aged ≥65 years increased threefold, from 6.9 (week ending April 2, 2022) to 27.6 (week ending May 28, 2022); hospitalization rates in adults aged 18–49 and 50–64 years both increased 1.7-fold during the same time interval. Hospitalization rates among unvaccinated adults were 3.4 times as high as those among vaccinated adults. Among hospitalized nonpregnant patients in this same period, 39.1% had received a primary vaccination series and 1 booster or additional dose; 5.0% had received a primary series and ≥2 boosters or additional doses. All adults should stay up to date† with COVID-19 vaccination, and multiple nonpharmaceutical and medical prevention measures should be used to protect those at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness, irrespective of vaccination status§ (1). 

COVID-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated hospitalizations (defined as receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular or rapid antigen detection test result during hospitalization or during the 14 days preceding admission) in 99 counties across 14 U.S. states.¶ This analysis describes weekly hospitalization rates among adults aged ≥18 years during June 20, 2021–May 28, 2022; monthly clinical and vaccination data were available through May 31, 2022. Data from the BA.2 period were compared with those from the Delta (B.1.617.2; June 20–December 18, 2021) and BA.1 (Omicron B.1.1.529 and BA.1.1; December 19, 2021–March 19, 2022) periods. 

Among all adults,** hospitalization rates were calculated overall, and by age and COVID-19 vaccination status. Vaccination status (i.e., unvaccinated, received primary series only, or received primary series and ≥1 booster or additional dose) was determined for individual hospitalized patients and for the catchment population using state immunization information systems data. Recipients of primary series only include hospitalized persons who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result from a specimen collected ≥14 days after either the second of a 2-dose vaccination series or after 1 dose of a single-dose vaccine but who have not received a booster or additional doses. Recipients of primary series with ≥1 booster or additional dose include hospitalized persons who received a primary vaccination series and a booster or additional dose on or after August 13, 2021, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result from a specimen collected ≥14 days after receipt of ≥1 booster or additional dose. Because the immune status of all patients is not known, an additional dose (recommended for persons with a compromised immune system) cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This issue is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in persons with a compromised immune system. These data do not yet distinguish between multiple booster or additional doses. Unvaccinated patients include those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result who have no record of receiving any COVID-19 vaccine doses†† (2). Rate ratios were calculated by dividing rates of hospitalization among unvaccinated persons by rates among vaccinated persons by month and by period of variant predominance and age group. 

Using previously described methods (3,4), clinical data were collected on an age- and site-stratified representative sample of hospitalized adult patients. Pregnant patients were excluded because their reasons for hospital admission (3) might differ from those for nonpregnant persons. Surveillance officers abstracted data on sampled patients from medical charts, including reason for admission.§§ 

Percentages presented were weighted to account for the probability of selection for sampled cases. Variances were estimated using Taylor series linearization method. Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software survey procedures (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶ 

During June 20, 2021–May 31, 2022, a total of 121,007 hospitalizations in COVID-NET were recorded. During the BA.2 period, among adults aged ≥65 years, hospitalization rates increased threefold, from a nadir of 6.9 (week ending April 2, 2022) to a peak of 27.6 (week ending May 28, 2022). During the same weeks, rates increased from 1.3 to 3.6 among adults aged 18–49 years and from 2.7 to 7.4 among adults aged 50–64 years, both a 1.7-fold increase (Figure 1). Compared with adults aged 18–49 years, hospitalization rate ratios for adults aged ≥65 years were 3.9, 5.7, and 8.2 in the Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 periods, respectively (Figure 2). 

Among 8,266 nonpregnant adults whose medical charts were abstracted, adults aged ≥65 years accounted for 41.0%, 49.6% and 61.5% of hospitalizations during the Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 periods, respectively (Table). Among nonpregnant hospitalized adults who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, the proportion likely admitted for a COVID-19–related illness accounted for 95.5% of hospitalizations during the Delta period, declining to 87.8% and 85.4% in the BA.1 and BA.2 periods, respectively. In adults aged ≥65 years, the proportions likely admitted for a COVID-19–related illness were 96.4%, 92.6%, and 93.4% for the Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 periods, respectively; these proportions were 95.8%, 89.2%, and 80.8% in adults aged 50–64 years and 93.4%, 76.3% and 70.6% in adults aged 18–49 years, respectively. 

During the BA.2 period, 27.8% of hospitalized adults were unvaccinated, representing a 60% decrease from 69.4% during the Delta period and a 41% decrease from 47.2% during the BA.1 period. The proportion who had received a primary series and ≥1 booster or additional dose increased from 1.4%, 15.6%, and 44.1% during the Delta, BA.1, and BA.2 periods, respectively. In May 2022, the monthly population-based, age-adjusted hospitalization rate among unvaccinated adults aged ≥18 years was 3.4 times as high (95% CI = 3.2–3.6) as rates among vaccinated adults who had received ≥1 booster or additional dose (CDC, COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network, unpublished data, 2022). 

During all periods, the percentage of hospitalized adults with at least one underlying medical condition ranged from 89.3% (Delta) to 95.1% (BA.2). Proportions of hospitalized adults admitted to an intensive care unit during the Delta, BA.1 and BA.2 periods were 24.3%, 17.9% and 13.2%, respectively. The proportion of in-hospital deaths during these periods declined from 12.4% (Delta) to 7.5% (BA.1) and 5.1% (BA.2).","During March 20–May 31, 2022, coinciding with the period of the Omicron BA.2 variant predominance, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates increased among adults aged ≥65 years relative to those in younger adults, and a higher proportion of those hospitalized were aged ≥65 years compared with that during the Delta and BA.1 periods. Nearly all hospitalized adults had one or more underlying medical condition. Hospitalization rates continue to remain higher among unvaccinated adults than among adults who received a primary COVID-19 vaccination series and ≥1 booster or additional dose. Approximately one third of hospitalized adults during the BA.2 period completed a primary series and received 1 booster or additional dose, and 5.0% received ≥2 booster or additional doses. These findings underscore the continued risk for COVID-19–associated hospitalization, particularly among unvaccinated persons and among older adults, irrespective of vaccination status. 

Older adults have experienced the highest hospitalization rates throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and the proportion of hospitalized adults aged ≥65 years increased during the Delta and Omicron periods. Approximately 90% of COVID-NET hospitalizations among adults aged ≥65 years during the BA.2 period were likely admitted for COVID-19–related illness, which demonstrates that severe COVID-19 continues to affect older adults. 

Multiple reasons likely contribute to the disproportionate increase in COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates among older adults. Older age remains the strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes; other risk factors include the presence of certain underlying medical conditions*** and being unvaccinated or not having received a COVID-19 primary vaccination series and a booster dose. Although vaccines remain effective at preventing severe illness (5), the proportion of hospitalized patients who are vaccinated is expected to increase as vaccination coverage increases. As of July 6, 2022, 91.6% of adults aged ≥65 years had received a primary series, 64.4% had received 1 booster or additional dose, and 22.2% received a second booster or additional doses,††† which was recommended for adults aged ≥50 years on March 29, 2022, during the BA.2 period.§§§ Not being up to date with COVID-19 vaccination might contribute to the increased hospitalization rates among adults in this age group. In addition, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness has been found to decline 6 months after vaccination, at least in part because of waning immunity, which might disproportionately affect rates among vaccinated older adults who received approval for vaccines earlier than did those in other age groups¶¶¶ (6). 

Nearly one half of adults hospitalized during the BA.2 period had received a primary vaccination series and ≥1 booster or additional dose. This finding indicates that in addition to increasing vaccination coverage and encouraging all adults to stay up to date with vaccinations, other multiple nonpharmaceutical and medical prevention measures should be implemented to protect persons at high risk for severe illness and hospitalization because of older age, disability, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or other underlying medical conditions (1). These additional measures include the use of masks or respirators that provide more protection for the wearer,**** early access to and use of antivirals, including ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and remdesivir (Veklury),†††† preexposure prophylaxis if indicated (e.g., Evusheld for persons who are immunocompromised), and following guidance on testing, isolation, and managing exposures§§§§ (1). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, some COVID-19–associated hospitalizations might have been missed because of hospital testing practices. Second, vaccination status is subject to misclassification, which might affect estimation of rates by vaccination status. In addition, because immunocompromise status is not always known, it is not possible to distinguish between booster and additional doses administered to persons who are immunocompromised; not having this information could also have influenced observed rates. Third, information on prehospital COVID-19 treatment was not reliably available in abstracted inpatient records to aid interpretation of clinical data. Fourth, the reason for admission was determined based on a specified algorithm; misclassification might have occurred, because reasons for admission are not always clear. Even among hospitalizations in which COVID-19 was not a likely reason for admission, COVID-19 might still affect clinical decision-making and outcomes. Finally, COVID-NET catchment areas include approximately 10% of the U.S. population; thus, findings might not be nationally generalizable. 

Coinciding with the predominance of the Omicron BA.2 variant, COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates increased during March–May 2022, mainly among adults aged ≥65 years. Hospitalization rates continue to be higher among those who are unvaccinated compared with those who were vaccinated with a primary series and ≥1 booster or additional dose. Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, including those who have been vaccinated, might still be at risk for severe disease as demonstrated by the fact that nearly one half of hospitalized patients during the BA.2 period had received a primary series and ≥1 booster or additional dose. In addition to staying up to date with vaccinations, other multiple nonpharmaceutical and medical prevention measures are important to reduce the risk for hospitalization among adults at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness.

Infants with very low birthweight (VLBW) are at increased risk for long- and short-term health problems. Human milk is the recommended nutrition source for infants with VLBW, who should receive supplemental donor milk when mother’s own milk is insufficient or unavailable. 

What is added by this report? 

Analysis of CDC’s 2020 Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care survey data found that donor milk was not available for infants with VLBW at 13.0% of U.S. hospitals with neonatal intensive care units (level III or IV). 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Identifying and addressing barriers to provision of donor milk for infants with VLBW could help ensure that these infants receive donor milk when needed and help decrease associated morbidity and mortality.

Approximately 50,000 infants are born in the United States each year with very low birthweight (VLBW) (<1,500 g).* Benefits of human milk to infants with VLBW include decreased risk for necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious illness resulting from inflammation and death of intestinal tissue that occurs most often in premature infants, especially those who are fed formula rather than human milk; late-onset sepsis; chronic lung disease; retinopathy of prematurity; and neurodevelopmental impairment (1). When mother’s own milk is unavailable or insufficient, pasteurized donor human milk (donor milk) plus a multinutrient fortifier is the first recommended alternative for infants with VLBW (2). CDC’s 2020 Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) survey was used to assess practices for donor milk use in U.S. advanced neonatal care units of hospitals that provide maternity care (3). Among 616 hospitals with neonatal intensive care units (level III or IV units),† 13.0% reported that donor milk was not available for infants with VLBW; however, approximately one half (54.7%) reported that most (≥80%) infants with VLBW do receive donor milk. Donor milk availability for infants with VLBW was more commonly reported among hospitals with a level IV unit, higher annual birth volume, location in the Midwest and Southwest regions, nonprofit and teaching status, and those designated Baby-Friendly.§ Addressing hospitals’ barriers to providing donor milk could help ensure that infants with VLBW receive donor milk when needed and help reduce morbidity and mortality in infants with VLBW (1,4). 

The mPINC survey is a biennial census of all maternity care hospitals in the United States and territories to monitor practices and policies related to infant feeding. The survey is completed electronically by the persons most knowledgeable about the hospital’s practices related to infant nutrition. In 2020, hospitals with advanced neonatal care units (level II, III, or IV) were asked how many infants (<1,500 g and ≥1,500 g) receive donor milk at any time while in the unit: few (0%–19%), some (20%–49%), many (50%–79%), most (≥80%), or donor milk not available. 

The prevalence of donor milk use was examined by unit level and infant weight¶ (<1,500 g and ≥1,500 g). For infants weighing ≥1,500 g, analyses included hospitals with level II, III, or IV units. Analyses for infants weighing <1,500 g were restricted to hospitals with level III or IV units, where infants with VLBW typically receive care (3). Donor milk use among infants with VLBW was also examined by hospital characteristics: hospital type, teaching hospital status, Baby-Friendly designation, number of annual births, and region.** Availability was also examined by state or territory (state) by calculating the percentage of participating hospitals with a level III or IV neonatal intensive care unit in each state reporting that donor milk was available for infants with VLBW. Data were suppressed for states with fewer than five hospitals reporting. Descriptive analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). Because this is a census sample, SEs were not calculated, and statistical testing was not performed. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† 

In 2020, among 2,810 eligible maternity hospitals, 2,103 (74.8%) participated in mPINC. Among participating hospitals, 1,260 (59.9%) reported having an advanced neonatal care unit, including 642 (60.0%) level II, 528 (41.9%) level III, and 90 (7.1%) level IV units. Hospitals that did not answer the donor milk question were excluded, resulting in analytic samples of 616 hospitals with level III and IV units for infants <1,500 g and 1,256 hospitals with level II, III, or IV units for infants ≥1,500 g. 

Among hospitals with level III or IV units, 13.0% reported that donor milk was not available for infants with VLBW, and 54.7% reported it was received by ≥80% of infants with VLBW (Table 1). Among hospitals with level II, III, or IV units, for infants weighing ≥1,500 g, 40.1% reported that donor milk was not available, and 15.9% reported that it was received by most of these infants. For both weight categories, donor milk was more commonly available and used at hospitals with level IV units than in those with level II or III. 

Donor milk was reported to be unavailable for infants with VLBW in 11.6% of nonprofit, 16.0% of for-profit, and 17.1% of government or military hospitals (Table 2). Among teaching hospitals, 12.4% reported that donor milk was not available, and 53.3% reported it was received by ≥80% of infants with VLBW, compared with 16.9% and 64.0%, respectively, among nonteaching hospitals. Donor milk was not available for infants with VLBW in 11.1% of Baby-Friendly designated hospitals, compared with 14.3% of non–Baby-Friendly designated hospitals. Although donor milk was available for infants with VLBW in almost all (97.8%) level IV units (Table 1), its availability and use among hospitals with a level III unit varied by hospital size. Among the largest hospitals with a level III unit (≥5,000 annual births), 6.3% reported that donor milk was not available, and 40.6% reported it was received by ≥80% of infants with VLBW, compared with 44.0% and 36.0%, respectively, among the smallest such hospitals (<1,000 annual births). By region, nonavailability of donor milk for infants with VLBW ranged from 4.1% of hospitals in the Midwest to 23.8% in the Northeast, among those with level III or IV units. 

Twenty-three U.S. states had at least 10 hospitals with a level III or IV neonatal intensive care unit, 13 had five to nine level III or IV hospitals, 15 had one to four level III or IV hospitals, and five had no hospital with level III or IV neonatal intensive care units participating in mPINC. Among the 36 states with five or more hospitals with a level III or IV unit, the statewide percentage of hospitals reporting donor milk availability for infants with VLBW ranged from 0% to 100% (median = 92.0%) (Figure). In 12 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin), 100% of hospitals with level III or IV units reported donor milk was available for infants with VLBW; in seven states (Illinois, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia), 90% to <100% of hospitals reported donor milk availability; in 10 states (Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Tennessee), 80% to <90% of hospitals reported donor milk availability; and in seven jurisdictions (California, Georgia, Kansas, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, and Puerto Rico), <80% of hospitals reported that donor milk was available.","Although human milk is the recommended nutrition source for infants with VLBW, with donor milk as the preferred alternative to mother’s own milk when needed, this analysis found that donor milk was unavailable or not frequently used in some hospitals caring for those infants. In mPINC 2020, 13.0% of hospitals with a level III or IV unit reported donor milk was not available for infants with VLBW; however, availability might be improving. In CDC’s 2018 mPINC survey, 16.5% of hospitals with a level III or IV unit reported donor milk was not available for infants with VLBW (CDC, unpublished data, 2022). In general, availability and use of donor milk for infants in advanced care units appears to be increasing over time. A 2011 study using mPINC data found that 45.2% of U.S. hospitals with a neonatal intensive care unit reported ever using donor milk (for infants of any birthweight); an increase from 25.1% in 2007 and 28.7% in 2009 (5). 

Limitations in the availability and use of donor milk for infants with VLBW might be due to a variety of factors. Most hospitals access donor milk from banks accredited by the nonprofit Human Milk Banking Association of North America, with 28 member milk banks currently operating in 25 states.§§ Availability of donor milk at hospitals might be affected by supply from milk banks, cost, and reimbursement, which can vary by state and payment source (6). Milk bank supply is in turn affected by barriers persons might face when considering milk donation, such as lack of knowledge about milk banking and beliefs about acceptability of donation (7). Hospital leadership support and logistical challenges to implementing donor milk programs might also play a role in donor milk availability (8). 

When donor milk is available, additional hospital- and individual-level factors might affect how often it is used. These include lack of standardized policies and staff member training related to donor milk use, as well as staff member and parent knowledge and perceptions about the health benefits and safety of donor milk (6). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the percentage of infants with VLBW needing supplementation to mother’s own milk or full feedings with donor milk is not well documented, making interpreting prevalence estimates of donor milk use among hospitals where it is available challenging because the ideal prevalence is not known. Second, there is potential for social desirability bias or other measurement error because hospitals’ use of donor milk is self-reported. Finally, mPINC does not collect data from neonatal units in hospitals that do not provide maternity care, such as children’s hospitals; therefore, donor milk use for infants with VLBW in those settings is not represented in this analysis. 

Addressing barriers related to the availability of milk banks, donation to milk banks, use of donor milk in hospitals, and knowledge and attitudes about donor milk could potentially increase its availability and use for infants with VLBW. The American Academy of Pediatrics and Baby-Friendly USA recently published documents outlining recommended practices for promoting human milk use for infants with VLBW and in the neonatal intensive care setting, which could provide guidance to hospitals implementing a donor milk program (1,4). State Perinatal Quality Collaboratives are another tool that could help birthing hospitals implement quality improvement initiatives to increase access to and use of donor milk to reduce morbidity and mortality in infants with VLBW.¶¶

A Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster dose is recommended for children aged 5–11 years; approximately 657,302 third doses were administered to children in this age group during May–July 2022. 

What is added by this report? 

Among children aged 5–11 years, local and systemic reactions were reported to v-safe with similar frequency after doses 2 and 3; specific reactions differed in severity. Vaccine administration errors were the most common events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. No reports of myocarditis or death after receipt of dose 3 were received. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Among children aged 5–11 years, serious adverse events after dose 3 are rare. Additional provider education might prevent vaccine administration errors.

On May 17, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine to authorize a homologous* booster dose for children aged 5–11 years ≥5 months after receipt of the second primary series dose† (1) based on findings from a clinical trial conducted among 401 children aged 5–11 years (2). To further characterize the safety of booster vaccination in this age group, CDC reviewed adverse events and health impact assessments after receipt of a Pfizer-BioNTech third dose reported to v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based safety surveillance system for adverse events occurring after COVID-19 vaccination, and adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive vaccine safety surveillance system comanaged by CDC and FDA. During May 17–July 31, 2022, approximately 657,302 U.S. children aged 5–11 years received a third Pfizer-BioNTech dose (either a third primary series dose administered to immunocompromised children or a booster dose administered to immunocompetent children)§; 3,249 Pfizer-BioNTech third doses were reported to v-safe for children in this age group. Local and systemic reactions were reported to v-safe after a second dose and a third dose with similar frequency; some reactions (e.g., pain) were reported to be moderate or severe more frequently after a third dose. VAERS received 581 reports of adverse events after receipt of a Pfizer-BioNTech third dose by children aged 5–11 years; 578 (99.5%) reports were considered nonserious, and the most common events reported were vaccine administration errors. Three (0.5%) reports were considered serious; no reports of myocarditis or death were received. Local and systemic reactions were common among children after Pfizer-BioNTech third dose vaccination, but reports of serious adverse events were rare. Initial safety findings are consistent with those of the clinical trial (2). 

V-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based U.S. active safety surveillance system established to monitor adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination (https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/). The v-safe platform allows existing registrants to report receipt of a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and new registrants to enter information about all doses they received. Registrants aged ≤15 years must be enrolled by a parent or guardian. Health surveys are sent daily during the first week after vaccine administration and include questions about potential local injection site and systemic reactions and health impacts.¶ CDC’s v-safe call center contacts parents who indicate that medical care was sought for their child after vaccination and encourages completion of a VAERS report, if indicated. 

VAERS is a U.S. national passive vaccine safety surveillance system comanaged by CDC and FDA that monitors adverse events after vaccination (3). VAERS accepts reports from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public.** VAERS reports are classified as serious if any of the following are reported: hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death.†† VAERS staff members assign Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs) to the signs, symptoms, and diagnostic findings in VAERS reports.§§ CDC and FDA physicians reviewed serious reports to VAERS to form a clinical impression based on available data. Selected MedDRA PTs were used to search for possible cases of myocarditis. Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare adverse events that have been associated with receipt of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, especially among adolescent males and young adults (4). 

This report assessed local and systemic reactions and health impacts reported in the week after vaccination among v-safe registrants aged 5–11 years who received a homologous Pfizer-BioNTech third dose ≥5 months after completion of their primary series during May 17–July 31, 2022. At least one survey after a third and at least one survey after a previous vaccine dose were required for inclusion. The odds of reporting an adverse reaction or health impact after receipt of the third dose and previous doses were compared using multivariable generalized estimating equations models.¶¶ VAERS reports for children aged 5–11 years who received a Pfizer-BioNTech third dose during May 17–July 31, 2022, were described by serious and nonserious classification, demographic characteristics, and MedDRA PTs.*** SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for all analyses. These surveillance activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††† 

Review of v-safe Data 
During May 17–July 31, 2022, a total of 3,249 homologous Pfizer-BioNTech third doses were reported to v-safe for children aged 5–11 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site pain (2,166; 66.7%), fatigue (938; 28.9%), and headache (647; 19.9%) (Table 1). Most reported reactions were mild in severity; reporting was most frequent the day after vaccination. Local injection site reactions (2,224; 68.5%) and systemic reactions (1,483; 45.6%) were frequently reported after third dose vaccination (Table 2). Local injection site reactions were reported with equal frequency after dose 3 (68.5%) and dose 2 (68.0%) (p = 0.65). The prevalences of reported systemic reactions were similar after dose 3 (45.6%) and dose 2 (45.8%) (p = 0.91). Although mild symptoms were most frequently reported, the frequency of reporting moderate or severe symptoms was higher after receipt of dose 3 than after dose 2 among those reporting pain, fatigue, headache, or myalgia. 

In the week after third dose vaccination, 6.9% (225) of enrolled children were reported to be unable to attend school, and 12.1% (392) were unable to complete daily activities. Approximately 1.0% of parents reported seeking medical care for their child after third dose vaccination, most commonly in an outpatient clinic (16; 0.5%) or via telehealth visit (11; 0.3%). No children received care at a hospital after third dose vaccination. Inability to attend school was reported less frequently after receipt of dose 3 (6.9%) than after dose 2 (10.0%) (p<0.001). Inability to complete daily activities was reported more frequently after dose 3 (12.1%) than after dose 2 (7.5%) (p<0.001). Receipt of medical care after dose 3 (1.0%) and dose 2 (0.9%) did not differ significantly (p = 0.52). 

Review of VAERS Data 
During May 17–July 31, 2022, VAERS received and processed 581 reports of one or more adverse events after Pfizer-BioNTech third dose vaccination among children aged 5–11 years; recipients’ median age was 9 years, and 275 (47.3%) reports were for girls. Most reports (573; 98.6%) indicated that the third COVID-19 dose was the sole vaccine administered at the encounter. Overall, 578 (99.5%) VAERS reports were classified as nonserious (Table 3). Among nonserious reports, the most commonly reported events (413; 71.1%) were related to vaccine preparation or administration errors (e.g., product preparation issue or error, incorrect dose administered, and product administered to patient of inappropriate age); 63 (15.3%) of these 413 reports also listed an adverse health event. Other commonly reported events among nonserious reports included fever (45; 7.8%), pain in extremity (38; 6.6%), and fatigue (28; 4.8%). The three serious reports included new onset type 1 diabetes 10 days after vaccination, facial swelling 3 days after vaccination, and generalized pain, fatigue, and malaise 5 days after vaccination requiring hospitalization. There were no reports to VAERS of either myocarditis or death.","This report provides safety findings from v-safe and VAERS data collected during the first 10 weeks of administration of Pfizer-BioNTech booster doses to children aged 5–11 years, a period in which approximately 657,302 third doses were administered in this age group. Adverse reactions reported to v-safe and VAERS for children aged 5–11 years after receipt of a third dose were similar to adverse reactions reported in the Pfizer-BioNTech clinical trial, reinforcing the safety of vaccination in this population (2). 

Among reports to v-safe for children aged 5–11 years, reports of local and systemic reactions after third dose vaccination were similar in frequency to those reported after a primary series (5–7). Although local and systemic reactions were similarly reported after receipt of dose 2 and dose 3, some reactions were more frequently reported as moderate or severe after a third than a second dose. This reporting pattern is consistent with clinical trial results (2). Parents reported symptom severity in v-safe based on how the symptom affected their child’s ability to complete daily activities. Thus, more common reporting of moderate-to-severe reactions likely reflects increased reporting of the health impact “inability to perform normal daily activities.” However, there was no significant difference between the proportions of children receiving medical attention after receipt of the second or third doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 

Approximately 99% of reports to VAERS for children aged 5–11 years after a Pfizer-BioNTech third dose were classified as nonserious. The most common adverse events reported were related to vaccine administration errors, most of which did not have an accompanying adverse health event. Children aged 5–11 years were the first to receive a smaller amount of mRNA (10 μg, 0.2 mL) than that recommended for persons aged ≥12 years (30 μg, 0.3 mL) (1). Therefore, continued education of vaccine providers might help reduce administration errors, including incorrect dosing, among children. Other common reactions reflect known associations with mRNA vaccines. These findings are consistent with previous analyses of VAERS reports following primary series vaccination in this age group (5,6). 

No VAERS reports of myocarditis after third doses among children aged 5–11 years were received. Among children and adolescents aged <18 years, myocarditis risk after COVID-19 vaccination is higher in males (4), and risk decreases with decreasing age (4,8); the myocarditis reporting rate to VAERS after dose 2 was 2.6 per 1 million doses among boys aged 5–11 years and 46.4 per 1 million doses among males aged 12–15 years (8). The risk for myocarditis after dose 3 appears to be less than that after dose 2; among males aged 12–15 years, the reporting rate to VAERS after dose 3 (15.3 per 1 million doses) was approximately one third of that after dose 2 (46.4) (8). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, v-safe participation is voluntary, and data might not be representative of the entire vaccinated U.S. population. Second, recipients who experience an adverse event might be more likely to respond to v-safe surveys. Third, v-safe does not include information about immune status; third dose recipients likely include persons with and without immunocompromising conditions. Fourth, VAERS is subject to reporting biases and underreporting, especially of nonserious events (3). Finally, these data are limited by the 10-week surveillance period. Findings might change as safety monitoring continues and more children aged 5–11 years receive booster doses. In particular, the frequency of vaccine error reports might decline as vaccine administrators gain additional experience with pediatric doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. 

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that all children aged 5–11 years receive 1 COVID-19 mRNA booster dose ≥5 months after completion of their primary COVID-19 mRNA series; immunocompromised children aged 5–11 years are recommended to receive a 3-dose primary series (with dose 3 administered ≥4 weeks after dose 2), followed by a booster dose ≥3 months after completion of the primary series.§§§ Vaccination continues to be the most effective preventive measure against serious illness and death from COVID-19. Preliminary safety findings for third doses administered to children aged 5–11 years are generally similar to those reported in the clinical trial (2). Health care providers and parents should expect local and systemic reactions among children in the week after Pfizer-BioNTech booster vaccination. Serious reports of adverse events are rare. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates as needed to guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.","Corresponding author: Anne M.

In 2002, coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in the World Health Organization’s South-East Asia Region (SEAR) was 70%, but only three countries had added a second routine dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2). 

What is added by this report? 

During 2003–2020, all countries in SEAR introduced MCV2, and estimated MCV1 and MCV2 coverage increased from 65% to 88% and from 6% to 80%, respectively. Reported measles incidence declined by 92%; measles vaccination averted an estimated 9.3 million deaths. Five countries achieved measles elimination by 2020, and the region adopted a 2023 goal of measles and rubella elimination. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

To achieve measles elimination in SEAR by 2023, additional efforts are urgently needed to strengthen routine immunization services and improve measles-containing vaccine coverage, conduct periodic high-quality supplementary immunization activities, and strengthen measles case-based surveillance and laboratory capacity.

In 2013, member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region* (SEAR) adopted the goal of measles elimination and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome control† by 2020 (1). In 2014, to provide impetus toward achieving this goal, the Regional Director declared measles elimination and rubella control one of the Regional Flagship Priorities. In 2019, SEAR member states declared a revised goal of eliminating both measles and rubella§ by 2023 (2). The recommended strategies to achieve elimination include 1) achieving and maintaining ≥95% coverage with 2 doses of measles- and rubella-containing vaccine in every district through routine or supplementary immunization activities¶ (SIAs); 2) developing and sustaining a sensitive and timely case-based surveillance system that meets recommended performance indicators**; 3) developing and maintaining an accredited laboratory network; 4) achieving timely identification, investigation, and response to measles outbreaks; and 5) collaborating with other public health initiatives to achieve the preceding four strategies. This report updates a previous report and describes progress toward measles elimination in SEAR during 2003–2020 (3). In 2002, coverage with the first dose of a measles-containing vaccine in routine immunization (MCV1) was 70%, and only three countries in SEAR had added a second routine dose of measles-containing vaccine in routine immunization (MCV2). During 2003–2020, all countries introduced MCV2, and estimated coverage with MCV1 increased 35%, from 65% to 88%, and coverage with MCV2 increased 1,233% from 6% to 80%. Approximately 938 million persons were vaccinated in SIAs. Annual reported measles incidence declined by 92%, from 57.0 to 4.8 cases per 1 million population, and estimated deaths decreased by 97%; an estimated 9.3 million deaths were averted by measles vaccination. By 2020, five countries were verified as having achieved measles elimination. To achieve measles elimination in the region by 2023, additional efforts are urgently needed to strengthen routine immunization services and improve measles-containing vaccine (MCV) coverage, conduct periodic high-quality SIAs, and strengthen measles case-based surveillance and laboratory capacity. 

Immunization Activities 
MCV1 was introduced in all 11 countries in SEAR before 2003 (Table 1). MCV2 was introduced in three countries (Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) before 2003; the remaining eight countries introduced MCV2 during 2003–2020. 

Countries report coverage for national and subnational MCV1 and MCV2 doses delivered through the routine immunization program to WHO and UNICEF, which use data from administrative records (vaccine doses administered divided by the estimated target population) and surveys reported by member states to estimate MCV1 and MCV2 coverage (4). Estimated MCV1 regional coverage increased 35%, from 65% in 2003 to 88% in 2020; five countries reported ≥95% MCV1 coverage in 2020 (Table 1) (Figure). The highest regional MCV1 coverage (94%) was reached in 2019, just before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimated MCV2 coverage increased 1,233%, from 6% in 2003 to 80% in 2020, with a peak of 83% in 2019; estimated MCV2 coverage in three countries was ≥95% in 2020. During 2003–2020, measles SIAs were conducted in all countries and reached approximately 938 million persons (Supplementary Table; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/120144). 

Surveillance Activities 
By 2020, case-based measles surveillance with laboratory confirmation of suspected cases†† was implemented in all countries in SEAR. A measles-rubella laboratory network was established in the region by 2003 as an integral component of the WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network. By 2020, the regional laboratory network included 49 proficient laboratories§§ with one regional reference laboratory (in Thailand); all countries had at least one proficient laboratory. In 2019, eight of 11 member states achieved the sensitivity indicator target of ≥2 discarded¶¶ measles cases per 100,000 population, and the regional discard rate was 1.68. In 2020, however, only five countries achieved the target discard rate of ≥2 per 100,000 population, and the regional discard rate was 0.98.

During 2003–2020, the number of reported*** measles cases decreased 90%, from 94,598 (2003) to 9,389 (2020). Annual measles incidence decreased 92%, from 57.0 cases per 1 million population to 4.8 cases per 1 million population (Table 1) (Figure). 

Among isolates from patients during 2017–2020, measles virus genotypes detected and reported in the region included D8 in the nine countries with endemic measles†††; B3 in Bangladesh, Burma,§§§ India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand; D4 mainly in India; and H1 in Burma, India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. However, genotype information is available for fewer than 1% of all confirmed measles cases in the region. 

Measles Case and Mortality Estimates 
A previously described model for estimating measles cases and deaths (5,6) was updated with recent data for countries in SEAR. Based on the updated model, the estimated number of measles cases decreased 84%, from 16,225,870 in 2003 to 2,552,584 in 2020; estimated annual measles deaths decreased 97%, from 163,044 to 5,649 (Table 2). During 2003–2020, compared with no vaccination, measles vaccination averted an estimated 9.3 million deaths in the region. 

Regional Verification of Measles Elimination 
The WHO South-East Asia Regional Verification Commission for measles and rubella elimination was established in 2016 and developed a framework for verification of measles and rubella elimination in the region (7). Subsequently, national verification committees have been established in all 11 countries; the national committees have provided annual reports on progress toward measles elimination. As of 2020, the Regional Commission has verified measles elimination in Bhutan (2017), Maldives (2017), North Korea (2018), Sri Lanka (2019), and Timor-Leste (2018). 

","During 2003–2020, substantial progress was made toward measles elimination in SEAR. Through implementation of the regional strategies, estimated MCV1 and MCV2 coverage increased 35% and 1,233%, respectively; reported measles incidence declined by 92%; and estimated measles deaths decreased by 97%. By the end of 2019, five of the 11 countries had been verified as having eliminated endemic measles transmission. 

In September 2019, after an extensive review of the progress made and the biologic, programmatic, and financial feasibility of measles and rubella elimination, the member states in the region updated the goal to achieve measles and rubella elimination by 2023 (2). However, challenges to achieving measles elimination in SEAR exist. During the COVID-19 pandemic, routine MCV1 coverage in the region declined from a peak of 94% in 2019 to 88% in 2020, and MCV2 coverage declined from a peak of 83% (2019) to 80% (2020). In 2020, among the estimated 22.3 million infants who did not receive MCV1 worldwide, approximately 18% were from SEAR, including 3 million in India and 0.6 million in Indonesia (4). In addition, measles surveillance sensitivity declined in all countries in the region, perhaps because COVID-19 mitigation measures (e.g., physical distancing and masking) decreased transmission of measles and other respiratory viruses but also because of reductions in clinic visits for febrile rash illness resulting from movement restrictions imposed nationally and the deployment of surveillance staff members to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent independent review of progress toward measles elimination in SEAR (8) concluded that several challenges, including immunity gaps, suboptimal sensitivity of surveillance, inadequate outbreak response and preparedness, funding gaps, and the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on immunization programs threaten achievement of the 2023 target. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, coverage estimates are based on administrative data and might be inaccurate because of errors in recording of doses administered or in estimates of the target populations. Second, surveillance data might underestimate true disease incidence because not all patients seek care and not all measles cases in patients who seek care are reported. Third, genotype data are based on a limited number of sequences and might not reflect the predominant genotypes in the region. Finally, the measles estimation model might be inaccurate because of errors in the immunization coverage estimates and reported cases as well as the inherent uncertainty of estimates based on modeling. 

Achieving measles elimination in SEAR by 2023 will require urgent intensified efforts by countries to implement strategies optimally and in a very short period, especially to mitigate the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on immunization services. The 2023 target date represents an opportunity to re-energize efforts and maintain momentum in the region to 1) obtain the highest level of political commitment from member states and support from partners; 2) strengthen routine immunization and achieve ≥95% coverage with MCV1 and MCV2; 3) conduct high-quality SIAs; 4) enhance surveillance sensitivity and increase collection of specimens for measles virus detection and genotyping; and 5) leverage measles elimination activities to enhance efforts to restore immunization services and reduce gaps in immunity to all vaccine-preventable diseases in recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2020, all 11 countries in SEAR had developed national plans for elimination based on strategies outlined in the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan (9) and the regional committee resolution (2). With 34.3 million surviving infants in SEAR (24% of the global total), regional measles elimination represents a substantial opportunity to decrease measles-related death and illness worldwide by 2023 (1,6,8).","Corresponding author: Sudhir Khanal, khanals@who.int, +91.11.23370804.","Suggested citation for this article: Khanal S, Kassem AM, Bahl S, et al.

Sustained poliovirus transmission has been eliminated from the United States for approximately 40 years; vaccines are highly effective in preventing paralysis after exposure. 

What is added by this report? 

In June 2022, poliovirus was confirmed in an unvaccinated immunocompetent adult resident of New York hospitalized with flaccid lower limb weakness. Vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 was isolated from the patient and identified from wastewater samples in two neighboring New York counties. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Unvaccinated persons in the United States remain at risk for paralytic poliomyelitis if they are exposed to either wild or vaccine-derived poliovirus; all persons in the United States should stay up to date on recommended poliovirus vaccination.

On July 18, 2022, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) notified CDC of detection of poliovirus type 2 in stool specimens from an unvaccinated immunocompetent young adult from Rockland County, New York, who was experiencing acute flaccid weakness. The patient initially experienced fever, neck stiffness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and limb weakness. The patient was hospitalized with possible acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). Vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) was detected in stool specimens obtained on days 11 and 12 after initial symptom onset. To date, related Sabin-like type 2 polioviruses have been detected in wastewater* in the patient’s county of residence and in neighboring Orange County up to 25 days before (from samples originally collected for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring) and 41 days after the patient’s symptom onset. The last U.S. case of polio caused by wild poliovirus occurred in 1979, and the World Health Organization Region of the Americas was declared polio-free in 1994. This report describes the second identification of community transmission of poliovirus in the United States since 1979; the previous instance, in 2005, was a type 1 VDPV (1). The occurrence of this case, combined with the identification of poliovirus in wastewater in neighboring Orange County, underscores the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent paralytic polio in persons of all ages. 

Case Findings 
In June 2022, a young adult with a 5-day history of low-grade fever, neck stiffness, back and abdominal pain, constipation, and 2 days of bilateral lower extremity weakness visited an emergency department and was subsequently hospitalized with suspected AFM; the patient was unvaccinated against polio (Figure). As part of national AFM surveillance,† the suspected case was reported to NYSDOH and then to CDC. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility 16 days after symptom onset with ongoing lower extremity flaccid weakness. A combined nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab and cerebrospinal fluid sample were negative by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for enteroviruses and human parechovirus, as well as for a panel of common respiratory pathogens and encephalitic viruses by molecular methods (2). RT-PCR and sequencing of a stool specimen by the NYSDOH laboratory identified poliovirus type 2. Specimens were tested at CDC using RT-PCR (3) and sequencing, confirming the presence of poliovirus type 2 in both stool specimens. Additional sequencing identified the virus as VDPV2 (4), differing from the Sabin 2 vaccine strain by 10 nucleotide changes in the region encoding the viral capsid protein, VP1, suggesting transmission for up to 1 year although the location of that transmission is unknown. 

Based on the typical incubation period for paralytic polio, the presumed period of exposure occurred 7 to 21 days before the onset of paralysis.§ Epidemiologic investigation revealed that the patient attended a large gathering 8 days before symptom onset and had not traveled internationally during the presumed exposure period. No other notable or known potential exposures were identified. 


Public Health Response 
Upon notification of the poliovirus-positive specimen, CDC, NYSDOH, and local health authorities launched an investigation and response on July 18, 2022. Activities included issuing a NYSDOH advisory on July 22 to increase health care provider awareness,¶ enhancing surveillance for potentially infected persons, testing wastewater from Rockland and surrounding New York counties, assessing vaccination coverage in the patient’s community, supplying inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to county immunization providers, and launching vaccination clinics throughout Rockland County. 

Enhanced surveillance defined persons under investigation (PUIs) as those who met clinical criteria and who lived in or traveled to specific counties or neighborhoods in New York or had international travel since May 1, 2022.** As of August 10, three additional persons have been classified as PUIs; available specimens from the PUIs (i.e., stool, cerebrospinal fluid, serum, nasopharyngeal, or oropharyngeal swabs) yielded negative poliovirus test results. 

As of August 10, a total of 260 wastewater samples from treatment plants in Rockland and Orange Counties, including samples originally collected for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, were tested for poliovirus. Among these samples, 21 (8%) yielded positive poliovirus test results using RT-PCR and partial genome sequencing, including 13 from Rockland County and eight from Orange County. Twenty specimens from wastewater samples collected during May, June, and July were genetically linked to virus from the patient’s stool samples; one additional sample, from April in Orange County, was sequenced as poliovirus type 2, but the sequence was incomplete, precluding assessment of genetic linkage to the case. After these results, in August 2022, additional clinical and public health surveillance activities, including additional outreach to local providers and syndromic surveillance, were launched to identify the presence of symptomatic nonparalytic infection (characterized by mild symptoms [e.g., low-grade fever and sore throat] or more severe symptoms [e.g., aseptic meningitis])†† and asymptomatic infection in the counties with poliovirus-positive wastewater findings. 

According to the New York State Immunization Information System, 3-dose polio vaccination coverage among infants and children aged <24 months living in Rockland County was 67.0% in July 2020 and declined to 60.3% by August 2022, with zip code–specific coverage as low as 37.3%.§§ National coverage for IPV by age 24 months was 92.7% among infants born during 2017–2018 (5). The Rockland County Department of Health launched a countywide catch-up vaccination effort on July 22, 2022. Although there was a brief increase in administration of polio-containing vaccines (IPV alone and combination vaccines including IPV), the number of doses administered at temporary and established clinics was not sufficient to meaningfully increase population IPV coverage levels.","The findings in this report represent only the second community transmission of poliovirus identified in the United States since 1979 (1). At present, the origin of the VDPV2 detected in the patient’s stool and in sewage samples remains unknown. Because the patient had not traveled internationally during the potential exposure period, detection of VDPV2 in the patient’s stool samples indicates a chain of transmission within the United States originating with a person who received a type 2-containing oral polio vaccine (OPV) abroad; OPV was removed from the routine immunization schedule in the United States in 2000. Genome sequence comparisons have identified a link to vaccine-related type 2 polioviruses recently detected in wastewater in Israel and the United Kingdom.¶¶ In general, approximately one in 1,900 poliovirus type 2 infections among unvaccinated persons is expected to result in paralysis (6). As of August 10, 2022, no additional poliomyelitis cases have been identified, although the detection of VDPV2 genetically linked to virus from the patient in wastewater specimens from two counties in New York State over the course of ≥2 months indicates community transmission and ongoing risk for paralysis to unvaccinated persons. 

VDPVs can emerge when live, attenuated OPV is administered in a community with low vaccination coverage. Replication of OPV in a person who was recently vaccinated can result in viral reversion to neurovirulence, which can cause paralytic poliomyelitis in unvaccinated persons who are exposed to the vaccine-derived virus. Since removal of OPV from the routine U.S. immunization schedule in 2000, IPV has been the only polio vaccine used in the United States. An inactivated vaccine, IPV does not replicate, revert to VDPV, or cause vaccine-associated paralytic polio. Vaccination with 3 doses of IPV is >99% effective in preventing paralysis***; however, IPV does not prevent intestinal infection and therefore does not prevent poliovirus transmission. 

Before this case, the last detection of poliovirus in a person in the United States was in 2013, in an immunocompromised infant who received OPV in India and then immigrated to the United States (1). VDPVs were identified in the United States in 2005 and 2008 in unvaccinated or immunodeficient persons who were in contact with a person who had recently received OPV; the 2008 case did not result in community transmission. Globally, type 2-containing vaccine (OPV2) has not been used in routine immunization since 2016, although monovalent OPV2 is used for specific vaccination campaigns to control circulating VDPV2 outbreaks (7). 

Low vaccination coverage in the patient’s county of residence indicates that the community is at risk for additional cases of paralytic polio. Even a single case of paralytic polio represents a public health emergency in the United States. Vaccination plays a critical role in protecting persons from paralysis if they are exposed to poliovirus. During the COVID-19 pandemic, routine vaccination services were disrupted, leading to a decline in vaccine administration and coverage (8,9), including with IPV, and leaving many communities at risk for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Until poliovirus eradication is achieved worldwide, importations of both wild polioviruses and VDPVs into the United States are possible. This case highlights the risk for paralytic disease among unvaccinated persons; all persons in the United States should stay up to date on recommended IPV vaccination to prevent paralytic disease.†††","Corresponding author: Ruth Link-Gelles, media@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Link-Gelles R, Lutterloh E, Schnabel Ruppert P, et al.

Workers who perform in-person work and come into close, frequent contact with other workers or the public might be at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection. 

What is added by this report? 

Public transportation industries in California experienced cumulative COVID-19 outbreak incidence and mortality rates 1.5 times as high as that for all industries; outbreak incidence was 5.2 times as high, and mortality was 1.8 times as high in bus and urban transit industries as in all industries. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Public transportation workers should be prioritized for COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination and enhanced workplace protection measures.

Work-related factors can contribute to risk for exposure to and infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and subsequent COVID-19–attributable outcomes, including death. Comparing COVID-19 metrics across industries can help identify workers at highest risk. Elevated COVID-19 mortality rates have been reported among all transportation workers, as well as specifically in public transportation industries (1–3). The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) calculated public transportation industry–specific COVID-19 outbreak incidence during January 2020–May 2022 and analyzed all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths among working-age adults in California to calculate public transportation industry–specific mortality rates during the same period. Overall, 340 confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks, 5,641 outbreak-associated cases, and 537 COVID-19–associated deaths were identified among California public transportation industries. Outbreak incidence was 5.2 times as high (129.1 outbreaks per 1,000 establishments) in the bus and urban transit industry and 3.6 times as high in the air transportation industry (87.7) as in all California industries combined (24.7). Mortality rates were 2.1 times as high (237.4 deaths per 100,000 workers) in transportation support services and 1.8 times as high (211.5) in the bus and urban transit industry as in all industries combined (114.4). Workers in public transportation industries are at higher risk for COVID-19 workplace outbreaks and mortality than the general worker population in California and should be prioritized for COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination and enhanced workplace protection measures. 

This report assessed confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks in California workplaces that began during January 1, 2020–May 26, 2022, and were reported to CDPH as of June 27, 2022. Confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks were defined as the occurrence of three or more probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases within a 14-day period among persons who are epidemiologically linked in the setting, are from different households, and are not identified as close contacts of one another in any other case investigation (4). Since January 1, 2021, California employers have been required to report workplace clusters of three or more COVID-19 cases within 14 days to their local health department (LHD); previously, outbreak reporting requirements varied by setting and jurisdiction. LHDs report confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks and the number of outbreak-associated cases, which might include workers and nonworkers, to CDPH. 

Separately, deaths among persons with laboratory-confirmed* COVID-19 were ascertained from California’s COVID-19 case registry, using LHD determinations to identify COVID-19 decedents.† Case registry records were probabilistically matched to state death certificate data, which include information about decedent industry and occupation. COVID-19 decedents with date of death during January 1, 2020–May 26, 2022, were analyzed; analysis was restricted to working adults aged 18–64 years. 

Standard 2012 U.S. Census Bureau industry codes were manually assigned to outbreaks using employer information and were assigned to death certificate free text for “usual industry” using an automated coding system (5). The numbers of outbreaks, outbreak-associated cases, and COVID-19–associated deaths were calculated for public transportation industries overall and for the five included individual industries§: air transportation, rail transportation, bus service and urban transit, taxi and limousine service (including shared ride services), and transportation support services (e.g., transportation maintenance services and airport cargo or terminal services). 

For industries with 10 or more outbreaks during the study period, industry-specific outbreak incidence, defined as number of outbreaks per 1,000 business establishments, was calculated, using data on numbers of establishments from the California Employment Development Department in 2020 as denominators.¶ Monthly employment data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020–2022 Current Population Survey were used as denominators to calculate industry-specific annual, cumulative, and age-standardized mortality rates. Outbreak incidence and mortality rates in public transportation industries were compared to overall rates for all California industries combined. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). The California Health and Human Services Agency’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects determined that this project constituted public health practice, not research, and therefore did not require further human subjects review.** 

A total of 340 COVID-19 outbreaks, 5,641 outbreak-associated cases, and 537 COVID-19–associated deaths occurred in public transportation industries in California (Table 1) (Table 2). The largest number of outbreaks (194; 57.1%) occurred in bus and urban transit workplaces, the largest number of outbreak-associated cases occurred in air transportation (2,411; 42.7%), and the largest number of deaths (270; 50.3%) occurred among workers in transportation support services. 

During January 1, 2020–May 26, 2022, the cumulative outbreak incidence for all public transportation industries (35.3 outbreaks per 1,000 establishments) was 1.4 times as high as that for all industries (24.7) (Table 1). Among individual public transportation industries, cumulative outbreak incidence was 5.2 times as high in bus and urban transit (129.1) and 3.6 times as high in air transportation (87.7) as in all industries. Annual outbreak incidence in public transportation industries increased by 68.4%, from 11.7 outbreaks per 1,000 establishments in 2020 to 19.7 in 2021, whereas outbreak incidence across all industries increased by 22.9% (from 8.3 to 10.2) during the same period. Numbers of outbreaks increased during COVID-19 surges; the highest monthly number of COVID-19 outbreaks in public transportation industries (79) was reported in December 2021, during the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant surge (Figure). 

The cumulative crude mortality rate for all public transportation industries was 174 per 100,000 workers, 1.5 times as high as the rate across all industries (Table 2). Cumulative crude mortality rates among workers in transportation support services (237), rail transportation (242), and bus service and urban transit (211) were approximately twice those across all industries (114). Age-adjusted mortality rates for all public transportation industries combined increased 68.1%, from 55.5 per 100,000 workers during 2020 to 93.3 during 2021 and were 1.5 times as high in 2020 and 1.4 times as high during 2021 as in all industries. The highest monthly number of COVID-19–associated deaths occurred during December 2020 and January 2021 (81 per month); an increase was also observed in September 2021 during California’s SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant surge (Figure). 

","COVID-19 outbreak incidence and mortality rates are higher in public transportation industries in California compared with all industries combined. Workers in these industries have continued to report to work throughout the pandemic, and many have jobs involving close, frequent contact with coworkers and the public. Among New York City transit workers who died of COVID-19 early in the pandemic, 57% worked in public-facing positions (6). Previous reports in Europe identified elevated mortality risk among public transportation workers; taxi and bus drivers were found to have the highest COVID-19 mortality rates among all occupational groups (2,3). This report also identified elevated outbreak incidence and mortality rates among bus and urban transit workers, in addition to elevated risk across all public transit industries combined. 

Although both outbreak incidence and mortality rates were elevated in the bus and urban transit industry, some differences were observed in other industries. Whereas COVID-19 fatalities were observed in the taxi and limousine industry, no outbreaks were identified, which might reflect the nature of the work (e.g., infrequent direct interaction with other workers) and the challenges of case and outbreak ascertainment with independent contractor work arrangements. Conversely, elevated outbreak incidence in air transportation relative to other transportation industries might partially reflect this industry’s enhanced outbreak identification and contact tracing capability, in addition to other work-related factors, such as duration and intensity of contact with others. 

Previous reports of excess all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality across occupational groups in California identified elevated mortality rates among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic workers compared with non-Hispanic White workers in transportation occupations (1,7). Although examination of outcomes by race and ethnicity was not possible in this analysis because of small numbers and missing data, additional investigation should explore how race, ethnicity, and other socioeconomic factors intersect with occupational risk for COVID-19 in public transportation industries. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, results were limited to California and might not be generalizable to other jurisdictions. Second, a statewide outbreak-reporting mandate was not implemented until January 1, 2021, which might have resulted in underestimation of 2020 outbreaks and limits the ability to compare outbreak incidence between 2020 and 2021. Third, age-adjusted mortality rates could not be calculated for individual industries because of small numbers; other confounding factors (e.g., race and ethnicity, presence of underlying medical conditions, vaccination status, and use of protective measures such as masks) might also affect outbreak and mortality rates and could not be adjusted for in this analysis. Fourth, although the industries analyzed here are public transportation industries, they include some workers who are not in public-facing roles; distinguishing these workers from public-facing workers was not possible in this analysis, and transmission might have occurred between coworkers as well as between workers and members of the public. Fifth, workers could not be distinguished from nonworkers in outbreak-associated case counts and, although death counts were limited to working-age persons and excluded those identified as unemployed or retired, some misclassification of working status remains possible. Decedents were classified by “usual industry,” which might also have led to misclassification of persons with more than one source of employment. Finally, identifying a specific source of COVID-19 exposure for individual patients is challenging because of the occurrence of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission and limitations in contact tracing, particularly for workers who come into frequent close contact with many persons; therefore, determining whether and how COVID-19 exposures occurred in the workplace can be difficult, particularly when analyzing aggregate data. 

The elevated outbreak incidence identified in public transportation industries suggests higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 workplace exposure among public transportation workers, and elevated mortality rates suggest increased risk for dying from COVID-19. Regardless of whether exposures occur from interactions with the public, coworkers, or other sources, these observations indicate that public transportation workers represent a vulnerable group who should be prioritized for COVID-19 prevention strategies. Such strategies can include targeted vaccination efforts, access to antiviral treatments, public health messaging, and enhanced workplace protection measures, such as improved ventilation and use of well-fitted masks or respirators (e.g., N95s) by workers and members of the public (8,9).","Corresponding author: Amy Heinzerling, amy.heinzerling@cdph.ca.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Heinzerling A, Vergara XP, Gebreegziabher E, et al.

High levels of immunity and availability of effective COVID-19 prevention and management tools have reduced the risk for medically significant illness and death. 

What is added by this report? 

To prevent medically significant COVID-19 illness and death, persons must understand their risk, take steps to protect themselves and others with vaccines, therapeutics, and nonpharmaceutical interventions when needed, receive testing and wear masks when exposed, receive testing if symptomatic, and isolate for ≥5 days if infected. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Medically significant illness, death, and health care system strain can be reduced through vaccination and therapeutics to prevent severe illness, complemented by use of multiple prevention methods to reduce exposure risk and an emphasis on protecting persons at high risk for severe illness.

As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to circulate globally, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post–COVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death (1). These circumstances now allow public health efforts to minimize the individual and societal health impacts of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce medically significant illness as well as to minimize strain on the health care system, while reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity (2). Individual risk for medically significant COVID-19 depends on a person’s risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and their risk for developing severe illness if infected (3). Exposure risk can be mitigated through nonpharmaceutical interventions, including improving ventilation, use of masks or respirators indoors, and testing (4). The risk for medically significant illness increases with age, disability status, and underlying medical conditions but is considerably reduced by immunity derived from vaccination, previous infection, or both, as well as timely access to effective biomedical prevention measures and treatments (3,5). CDC’s public health recommendations change in response to evolving science, the availability of biomedical and public health tools, and changes in context, such as levels of immunity in the population and currently circulating variants. CDC recommends a strategic approach to minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on health and society that relies on vaccination and therapeutics to prevent severe illness; use of multicomponent prevention measures where feasible; and particular emphasis on protecting persons at high risk for severe illness. Efforts to expand access to vaccination and therapeutics, including the use of preexposure prophylaxis for persons who are immunocompromised, antiviral agents, and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, should be intensified to reduce the risk for medically significant illness and death. Efforts to protect persons at high risk for severe illness must ensure that all persons have access to information to understand their individual risk, as well as efficient and equitable access to vaccination, therapeutics, testing, and other prevention measures. Current priorities for preventing medically significant illness should focus on ensuring that persons 1) understand their risk, 2) take steps to protect themselves and others through vaccines, therapeutics, and nonpharmaceutical interventions when needed, 3) receive testing and wear masks if they have been exposed, and 4) receive testing if they are symptomatic, and isolate for ≥5 days if they are infected. 


Vaccines and Therapeutics To Reduce Medically Significant Illness 
COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines are highly protective against severe illness and death and provide a lesser degree of protection against asymptomatic and mild infection (6). Receipt of a primary series alone, in the absence of being up to date with vaccination* through receipt of all recommended booster doses, provides minimal protection against infection and transmission (3,6). Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time. The rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death are substantially higher among unvaccinated adults than among those who are up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination, particularly adults aged ≥65 years (5,7). Emerging evidence suggests that vaccination before infection also provides some protection against post–COVID-19 conditions,† and that vaccination among persons with post–COVID-19 conditions might help reduce their symptoms (8). Continuing to increase vaccination coverage and ensuring that persons are up to date with vaccination are essential to preventing severe outcomes. Overall booster dose coverage in the United States remains low,§ which is concerning given the meaningful reductions in risk for severe illness and death that booster doses provide and the importance of booster doses to counter waning of vaccine-induced immunity. Public health efforts to expand reach and promote equitable access to vaccination have resulted in similar rates of primary series coverage across most racial and ethnic groups (9); however, racial and ethnic disparities in booster coverage have emerged (10). Supporting community partnerships and leveraging trusted sources of information must continue in order to eliminate persistent disparities and achieve equity in booster dose coverage, including through increasing education efforts and promotion of equitable vaccination outreach. Public health efforts need to continue to promote up-to-date vaccination for everyone, especially with vaccines targeting emerging novel variants that might be more transmissible or immune-evasive. 

Preexposure prophylaxis. COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes is lower in persons who are immunocompromised than in those who are not, and persons who are immunocompromised and have COVID-19 are at increased risk for intensive care unit admission and death while hospitalized, irrespective of their vaccination status (11,12). Preexposure prophylaxis with Evusheld¶ can help protect persons with moderate to severe immunocompromise who might not mount an adequate immune response after COVID-19 vaccination, as well as persons for whom COVID-19 vaccination is not recommended because of their personal risk for severe adverse reactions. In addition to early antiviral treatment if infected, persons who are moderately or severely immunocompromised can benefit from COVID-19 preexposure prophylactic medication to help prevent severe COVID-19 illness, as an adjunct to up-to-date vaccination for themselves and their close contacts, early testing, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and prompt access to treatment if they are infected. 

Medications to treat COVID-19. Antiviral medications (Lagevrio [molnupiravir], Paxlovid [nirmatrelvir and ritonavir], and Veklury [remdesivir]) and monoclonal antibodies (bebtelovimab) are available to treat COVID-19 in persons who are at increased risk for severe illness,** including older adults, unvaccinated persons, and those with certain medical conditions†† (13). Antiviral agents reduce risk for hospitalization and death when administered soon after diagnosis. The federal Test to Treat initiative facilitates rapid, no-cost access to oral COVID-19 treatment for eligible persons who receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.§§ Recent expansion of prescribing authority of Paxlovid to pharmacists intends to further facilitate access.¶¶ Continued efforts are needed to reduce racial and ethnic differences in receipt of monoclonal antibody therapies (14) and disparities in dispensing rates for oral antiviral prescriptions by community social vulnerability (15). 


COVID-19 Prevention Strategies 
Monitoring COVID-19 Community Levels to guide COVID-19 prevention efforts. Persons can use information about the current level of COVID-19 impact on their community to decide which prevention behaviors to use and when (at all times or at specific times), based on their own risk for severe illness and that of members of their household, their risk tolerance, and setting-specific factors. CDC’s COVID-19 Community Levels reflect the current effect of COVID-19 on communities and identify geographic areas that might experience increases in severe COVID-19–related outcomes, based on hospitalization rates, hospital bed occupancy, and COVID-19 incidence during the preceding period*** (1). Prevention recommendations based on COVID-19 Community Levels have the explicit goals of reducing medically significant illness and limiting strain on the health care system. At all COVID-19 Community Levels (low, medium, and high), recommendations emphasize staying up to date with vaccination, improving ventilation, testing persons who are symptomatic and those who have been exposed, and isolating infected persons. At the medium COVID-19 Community Level, recommended strategies include adding protections for persons who are at high risk for severe illness (e.g., use of masks or respirators that provide a higher level of wearer protection). At the high COVID-19 Community Level, additional recommendations focus on all persons wearing masks indoors in public and further increasing protection to populations at high risk.††† As SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate, changes in COVID-19 Community Levels for a jurisdiction help signal when use of some prevention strategies should be discontinued or increased, based on an individual person’s level of risk for severe illness or that of their household or social contacts. The COVID-19 Community Levels provide a broad framework for public health officials and jurisdictions to use and adapt as needed based on local context by combining local information to assess the need for public health interventions. 

Nonpharmaceutical interventions. Implementation of multiple prevention strategies helps protect individual persons and communities from SARS-CoV-2 exposure and reduce risk for medically significant illness and death by reducing risk for infection (Table). Implementation of multiple nonpharmaceutical preventive interventions can complement use of vaccines and therapeutics, especially as COVID-19 Community Levels increase and among persons at high risk for severe illness. CDC’s COVID-19 prevention recommendations no longer differentiate based on a person’s vaccination status because breakthrough infections occur, though they are generally mild (16), and persons who have had COVID-19 but are not vaccinated have some degree of protection against severe illness from their previous infection (17). In addition to strategies recommended at all COVID-19 Community Levels, education and messaging to help individual persons understand their risk for medically significant illness complements recommendations for prevention strategies based on risk. 

Testing for current infection. Diagnostic testing can identify infections early so that infected persons can take action to reduce their risk for transmitting virus and receive treatment, if clinically indicated, to reduce their risk for severe illness and death. All persons should seek testing for active infection when they are symptomatic or if they have a known or suspected exposure to someone with COVID-19. When considering whether and where to implement screening testing of asymptomatic persons with no known exposure, public health officials might consider prioritizing high-risk congregate settings, such as long-term care facilities, homeless shelters, and correctional facilities, and workplace settings that include congregate housing with limited access to medical care.§§§ In these types of high-risk congregate settings, screening testing might complement diagnostic testing of symptomatic persons by identifying asymptomatic infected persons (18,19). When implemented, screening testing strategies should include all persons, irrespective of vaccination status. Screening testing might not be cost-effective in general community settings, especially if COVID-19 prevalence is low (20,21). 

Isolation. Symptomatic or infected persons should isolate promptly, and infected persons should remain in isolation for ≥5 days and wear a well-fitting and high-quality mask or respirator if they must be around others. Infected persons may end isolation after 5 days, only when they are without a fever for ≥24 hours without the use of medication and all other symptoms have improved, and they should continue to wear a mask or respirator around others at home and in public through day 10¶¶¶ (Figure) (22,23). Persons who have access to antigen tests and who choose to use testing to determine when they can discontinue masking should wait to take the first test until at least day 6 and they are without a fever for ≥24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication and all other symptoms have improved. Use of two antigen tests with ≥48 hours between tests provides more reliable information because of improved test sensitivity (24). Two consecutive test results must be negative for persons to discontinue masking. If either test result is positive, persons should continue to wear a mask around others and continue testing every 48 hours until they have two sequential negative results.**** 

Managing SARS-CoV-2 exposures. CDC now recommends case investigation and contact tracing only in health care settings and certain high-risk congregate settings.†††† In all other circumstances, public health efforts can focus on case notification and provision of information and resources to exposed persons about access to testing. Persons who have had recent confirmed or suspected exposure to an infected person should wear a mask for 10 days around others when indoors in public and should receive testing ≥5 days after exposure (or sooner, if they are symptomatic), irrespective of their vaccination status.§§§§ In light of high population levels of anti–SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (7,16), and to limit social and economic impacts, quarantine of exposed persons is no longer recommended, regardless of vaccination status. 

Protecting Persons Most at Risk for Severe Illness 
Multiple nonpharmaceutical and medical prevention measures are available to substantially reduce the risk for medically significant illness and death among persons at particularly high risk for these outcomes because of older age, disability, moderate or severe immunocompromise (25), or other underlying medical conditions (including pregnancy) (26). In addition to recommending that persons stay up to date with vaccination, public health strategies to protect persons at high risk include use of masks or respirators (i.e., specialized filtering masks such as N95/KN95s) that provide more protection for the wearer,¶¶¶¶ preexposure prophylaxis if indicated (e.g., for persons who are immunocompromised), and early access to and use of antivirals. At medium and high COVID-19 Community Levels, persons at high risk for severe illness and their contacts should consider wearing well-fitting masks or respirators that provide more protection to the wearer because of better filtration and fit to reduce exposure and infection risk. Persons who have household or social contact with persons at high risk should consider self-testing to detect infection before contact at medium and high COVID-19 Community Levels. Public health efforts should promote health equity by purposefully reaching out to all populations at high risk for severe illness to broaden access to preexposure prophylaxis, testing, and oral antivirals. Public health practitioners and organizations should consider the characteristics of their local or setting-specific populations when determining whether to strengthen or add prevention strategies that supplement disease control efforts and protect those persons at highest risk for severe illness or death. Strengthening public health communications and messaging can also help persons assess their personal level of risk for severe illness and use that knowledge to choose preventive behaviors to protect themselves and those around them.*****","COVID-19 remains an ongoing public health threat; however, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of medical and nonpharmaceutical interventions have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. As transmission of SARS-CoV-2 continues, the current focus on reducing medically significant illness, death, and health care system strain are appropriate and achievable aims that are supported by the broad availability of the current suite of effective public health tools. Rapid identification of emergent variants necessitating a shift in prevention strategy makes continued detection, monitoring, and characterization of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants essential. Incorporating actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 into long-term sustainable routine practices is imperative for society and public health.","Corresponding author: Greta M.

A global monkeypox outbreak began in 2022. 

What is added by this report? 

Among U.S. monkeypox cases with available data, 99% occurred in men, 94% of whom reported recent male-to-male sexual or close intimate contact; racial and ethnic minority groups appear to be disproportionately affected. Clinical presentations differed from typical monkeypox, with fewer persons experiencing prodrome and more experiencing genital rashes. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Public health efforts should prioritize gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, who are currently disproportionately affected, for prevention and testing, address equity, and minimize stigma, while maintaining vigilance for transmission in other populations. Clinicians should test persons with rash consistent with monkeypox, regardless of whether the rash is disseminated or was preceded by prodrome.

Monkeypox, a zoonotic infection caused by an orthopoxvirus, is endemic in parts of Africa. On August 4, 2022, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the U.S. monkeypox outbreak, which began on May 17, to be a public health emergency (1,2). After detection of the first U.S. monkeypox case), CDC and health departments implemented enhanced monkeypox case detection and reporting. Among 2,891 cases reported in the United States through July 22 by 43 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia (DC), CDC received case report forms for 1,195 (41%) cases by July 27. Among these, 99% of cases were among men; among men with available information, 94% reported male-to-male sexual or close intimate contact during the 3 weeks before symptom onset. Among the 88% of cases with available data, 41% were among non-Hispanic White (White) persons, 28% among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons, and 26% among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons. Forty-two percent of persons with monkeypox with available data did not report the typical prodrome as their first symptom, and 46% reported one or more genital lesions during their illness; 41% had HIV infection. Data suggest that widespread community transmission of monkeypox has disproportionately affected gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and racial and ethnic minority groups. Compared with historical reports of monkeypox in areas with endemic disease, currently reported outbreak-associated cases are less likely to have a prodrome and more likely to have genital involvement. CDC and other federal, state, and local agencies have implemented response efforts to expand testing, treatment, and vaccination. Public health efforts should prioritize gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, who are currently disproportionately affected, for prevention and testing, while addressing equity, minimizing stigma, and maintaining vigilance for transmission in other populations. Clinicians should test patients with rash consistent with monkeypox,† regardless of whether the rash is disseminated or was preceded by prodrome. Likewise, although most cases to date have occurred among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, any patient with rash consistent with monkeypox should be considered for testing. CDC is continually evaluating new evidence and tailoring response strategies as information on changing case demographics, clinical characteristics, transmission, and vaccine effectiveness become available.§ 

On June 3, 2022, CDC released a case report form for health departments to report monkeypox cases. Data collected include possible exposures during the 3 weeks preceding symptom onset, symptoms during the illness course, and distribution of rash, defined as at least one lesion on the skin or mucous membranes. To describe epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, CDC analyzed case report form data for probable or confirmed cases¶ initially reported through July 22, 2022; to allow for reporting delay, data received through July 27 were included. Analyses were restricted to cases for which relevant data were available. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.** 

During May 17–July 22, 2022, a total of 2,891 U.S. monkeypox cases were reported by 43 states, Puerto Rico, and DC; the number of reported cases increased rapidly during this time (Figure). Case report forms including, at minimum, age and gender identity were received for 1,195 (41%) cases; these cases are described in this report. Median age was 35 years (IQR = 30–41 years). Nearly all (99%) persons with case report forms available were men (cisgender and transgender) (Table 1). Among 1,054 cases for which race and ethnicity were reported, 41% occurred among White persons, 28% among Hispanic persons, and 26% among Black persons. Based on information available in case report forms, the percentage of cases among Black persons increased from 12% (29 of 248) during May 17–July 2 to 31% (247 of 806) during July 3–22, and the percentage among Hispanic persons decreased from 33% (82 of 248) to 27% (214 of 806) and among White persons from 49% (121 of 248) to 38% (307 of 806). 

Among 241 cases (20%) with reported classification by health departments as being travel-associated or locally acquired, 178 (74%) were classified as locally acquired. The percentage of locally acquired cases increased from 51% (33 of 65) during May 17–July 2 to 82% (145 of 175) during July 3–22. 

Among 358 (30%) men (cisgender and transgender) with information on recent sexual behaviors and gender of sex partners available, 337 (94%) reported sex or close intimate contact with a man during the 3 weeks before symptom onset; 16 (4%) reported no such contact. Among 291 men who reported information about their male sexual partners during the 3 weeks preceding symptom onset, 80 (27%) reported one partner, 113 (40%) reported two to four partners, 42 (14%) reported five to nine partners, and 56 (19%) reported 10 or more partners. Among 86 men with information reported, 33 (38%) reported group sex, defined as sex with more than two persons, at a festival, group sex event, or sex party. 

The most frequently reported signs and symptoms included rash (100%), fever (63%), chills (59%), and lymphadenopathy (59%) (Table 2). Reported rectal symptoms included purulent or bloody stools (21%), rectal pain (22%), and rectal bleeding (10%). Among 291 persons with available information about their first symptoms, 58% reported at least one prodromal symptom††; for the 42% of patients without prodromal symptoms, illness began with a rash. 

Rash was most frequently reported on the genitals (46%), arms (40%), face (38%), and legs (37%); among 718 persons with monkeypox who reported body regions with rash, 238 (33%) reported rash in one region, 126 (18%) in two regions, 98 (14%) in three regions, and 256 (36%) in four or more regions. Among 104 persons with information on the number of lesions, 88% of cases involved fewer than 50 lesions. 

Among 334 persons with data available on HIV status, 136 (41%) had HIV infection. Among 954 persons with hospitalization data available, 77 (8%) patients were hospitalized because of their illness. No deaths were reported. Among 339 persons with vaccination status available, 48 (14%) reported previous receipt of smallpox vaccine, including 11 (23%) who received 1 of 2 JYNNEOS doses during the current outbreak, 11 (23%) who received pre-exposure prophylaxis at an unknown time before the current outbreak, and 26 (54%) who did not provide information about when vaccine was administered. Among the recently vaccinated persons with monkeypox, at least one experienced symptoms >3 weeks after their first JYNNEOS dose. 

","Current findings indicate that community transmission of monkeypox is widespread and is disproportionately affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men; this is consistent with data reported from other countries (3). Public health efforts to slow monkeypox transmission among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men require addressing challenges that include homophobia, stigma, and discrimination. Although the largest proportion of cases have occurred in White persons, Black and Hispanic persons, who represent approximately one third (34%) of the general population (4), accounted for more than one half (54%) of monkeypox cases in persons for whom information on race and ethnicity is available; further, the proportion of cases among Black persons has increased during recent weeks. Ensuring equity in approaches to monkeypox testing, treatment, and prevention is critical, and taking actions to minimize stigma related to monkeypox can reduce barriers to seeking care and prevention. The data presented in this report provide insights into early transmission; however, ongoing surveillance is essential to monitor future transmission trends and assess the impacts among different communities. 

These data can guide clinical considerations for evaluating persons for monkeypox. Typically, monkeypox begins with a febrile prodrome, which might include malaise, chills, headache, or lymphadenopathy, followed by a disseminated rash that often includes the palms and soles (5). Although most cases in this report included these features, 42% of persons did not report prodromal symptoms, and 37% did not report fever by the time of interview. Genital rash, although reported in fewer than one half of cases, was common; 36% of persons developed rash in four or more body regions. Other recent reports describe similar clinical characteristics (6,7). Clinicians should be vigilant for patients with rash consistent with monkeypox, regardless of whether the rash is disseminated or was preceded by prodrome. Likewise, although most cases to date have occurred among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, any patient, regardless of sexual or gender identity, with rash consistent with monkeypox should be considered for testing because close physical contact with an infectious person or exposure to contaminated materials such as clothing or bedding can result in transmission. 

A substantial proportion of monkeypox cases have been reported among persons with HIV infection, and efforts are underway to characterize monkeypox clinical outcomes among these persons. Recent reports have found that concurrent sexually transmitted infections were common in persons with monkeypox (3,7). Clinicians and health officials implementing monkeypox education, testing, and prevention efforts should also incorporate recommended interventions for other conditions occurring among gay and bisexual men, including HIV infection, sexually transmitted infections, substance use, and viral hepatitis§§ (8). 

On May 23, 2022, CDC launched an emergency response for monkeypox. This response includes educating providers and the public, expanding laboratory testing, outlining prevention strategies, and promoting the use of medical countermeasures for treatment and postexposure prophylaxis. CDC is supporting state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments through guidance and technical assistance. Testing capacity was rapidly expanded through CDC’s Laboratory Response Network and commercial laboratories, with national capacity estimates of 80,000 tests per week by July 18.¶¶ 

Because of long-standing investments in medical countermeasures for potential smallpox events, licensed vaccines and therapeutics for monkeypox are held in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Strategic National Stockpile. A national vaccine strategy was developed to equitably expand vaccination in areas experiencing high numbers of monkeypox cases and contacts. Two vaccines are available in the United States.*** As of August 3, more than 1 million doses of JYNNEOS, a nonreplicating, live virus vaccine (https://www.fda.gov/media/131078/download) had been allocated to jurisdictions, and approximately 14,700 courses of oral tecovirimat (TPOXX) had been distributed to jurisdictions and providers. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, this analysis includes only 41% of U.S. monkeypox cases reported through July 22 and might not be representative of all cases. Jurisdictions with high numbers of cases without submitted case report forms were more racially and ethnically diverse according to U.S. Census Bureau data; therefore, persons from racial and ethnic minority groups might be more disproportionately affected than indicated by these data. Second, even on submitted case report forms, data for variables such as timing of vaccination, sexual behaviors, HIV status, reason for hospitalization, and whether cases were travel-associated were frequently missing; data might also not reflect symptoms or outcomes occurring after the interview. Finally, persons with monkeypox who have mild symptoms might be less likely to seek care or initiate testing and could be underrepresented in this analysis. 

CDC is continually evaluating new evidence and tailoring response strategies as information on changing case demographics, clinical characteristics, transmission, and vaccine effectiveness become available. Public health efforts should prioritize gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, who are currently disproportionately affected for prevention and testing, address equity, and minimize stigma, while maintaining vigilance for transmission in other populations. Clinicians should test persons with rash consistent with monkeypox, regardless of whether the rash is disseminated or was preceded by prodrome.","Corresponding author: David Philpott, DPhilpott@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Philpott D, Hughes CM, Alroy KA, et al.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment is recommended for nearly all persons with hepatitis C and cures ≥95% of cases. Treatment saves lives, prevents transmission, and is cost saving. 

What is added by this report? 

Treatment rates are low overall and vary by age and insurance payor. DAA treatment is lowest among young adults aged 18–29 years and Medicaid recipients, and within Medicaid, among persons reporting Black or other race and persons in states with treatment restrictions. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Timely initiation of DAA treatment, regardless of insurance type, is critical to reducing viral hepatitis–related mortality, disparities, and transmission.

Abstract 
Introduction: Over 2 million adults in the United States have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and it contributes to approximately 14,000 deaths a year. Eight to 12 weeks of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment, which can cure ≥95% of cases, is recommended for persons with hepatitis C. 

Methods: Data from HealthVerity, an administrative claims and encounters database, were used to construct a cohort of adults aged 18–69 years with HCV infection diagnosed during January 30, 2019–October 31, 2020, who were continuously enrolled in insurance for ≥60 days before and ≥360 days after diagnosis (47,687). Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between initiation of DAA treatment and sex, age, race, payor, and Medicaid restriction status; adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were calculated. 

Results: The prevalence of DAA treatment initiation within 360 days of the first positive HCV RNA test result among Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance recipients was 23%, 28%, and 35%, respectively; among those treated, 75%, 77%, and 84%, respectively, initiated treatment within 180 days of diagnosis. Adjusted odds of treatment initiation were lower among those with Medicaid (aOR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.51–0.57) and Medicare (aOR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.56–0.68) than among those with private insurance. After adjusting for insurance type, treatment initiation was lowest among adults aged 18–29 and 30–39 years with Medicaid or private insurance, compared with those aged 50–59 years. Among Medicaid recipients, lower odds of treatment initiation were found among persons in states with Medicaid treatment restrictions (aOR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.74–0.81) than among those in states without restrictions, and among persons whose race was coded as Black or African American (Black) (aOR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.88–0.99) or other race (aOR = 0.73; 95% CI = 0.62–0.88) than those whose race was coded as White. 

Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Few insured persons with diagnosed hepatitis C receive timely DAA treatment, and disparities in treatment exist. Unrestricted access to timely DAA treatment is critical to reducing viral hepatitis–related mortality, disparities, and transmission. Treatment saves lives, prevents transmission, and is cost saving.

Introduction 
Despite the availability of accurate diagnostic tests and an effective cure, approximately 2.2 million civilian, noninstutionalized adults had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States during January 2017–March 2020,† and incidence continues to rise, particularly among younger adults and in association with injection drug use (1,2). Untreated, hepatitis C can lead to advanced liver disease, liver cancer, and death (3). Hepatitis C treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents is recommended for all persons with HCV infection with few exceptions (e.g., persons with a very limited life expectancy and children aged <3 years) (4). 

Hepatitis C treatment saves lives, prevents transmission, and is cost saving (5–8). Short course, safe, well-tolerated, oral-only hepatitis C treatment results in a cure in ≥95% of cases (9). However, only an estimated 1.2 million persons initiated hepatitis C treatment with DAA agents in the United States during 2014–2020 (10), far below the number needed to achieve national hepatitis C elimination goals (11). Further, the number of persons treated was highest in 2015 and declined to its lowest level in 2020 (10); approximately 14,200 hepatitis C–related deaths were reported in the United States in 2019 (2). This analysis used a large national health care claims database to assess hepatitis C treatment among persons with diagnosed HCV infection by sex, age, race, insurance type (i.e., private, Medicaid, and Medicare), and by state Medicaid treatment restrictions. 


Methods 
Deidentified data came from HealthVerity, a nationwide administrative claims and encounters database containing longitudinal person-level enrollment records, laboratory test results, and prescription information.§ The retrospective cohort in this study included approximately 2 million persons from all 50 states and the District of Columbia enrolled in private insurance plans, Medicare Advantage, or Medicaid managed care who had received a test for HCV infection and had ≥1 day of enrollment in either private insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare coverage (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/119619). HealthVerity claims capture complete health care use and enrollment records across physician outpatient visits, diagnostic centers, and pharmacies. Enrollment, laboratory test, and pharmacy claims databases were linked using HealthVerity’s person-level deterministic proprietary matching algorithm. 

An analytic cohort of patients with hepatitis C (those who received at least one positive HCV RNA test result during January 30, 2019–October 31, 2020) was created by selecting from among patients aged 18–69 years who received any HCV test. The earliest date of receipt of a positive HCV RNA test result that occurred within the selected time frame was defined as the index HCV RNA–positive test date. Eligible persons had continuous enrollment in medical and pharmacy plans for ≥60 days before and ≥360 days after the index RNA-positive test date, and no evidence of DAA treatment during the 60 days preceding the index HCV RNA test date. Initiation of DAA treatment was defined as receipt of any prescription using the Food and Drug Administration and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of America National Drug Codes definition.¶ For persons with a DAA treatment pharmacy claim, the first DAA prescription date was assigned as the index DAA treatment date. The interval from the positive index RNA test result to DAA treatment date for the treatment cohort was defined as the difference between the index HCV RNA–positive test date and the index DAA prescription fill date. Initiation of DAA treatment prevalence was calculated as the percentage of eligible patients who initiated DAA treatment within 360 days of the index RNA-positive test date. The primary outcome for analysis was receipt of a DAA pharmacy claim during the 360-day follow-up period. Covariates included sex (i.e., female or male), age group (i.e., 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60–69 years), race (i.e., White, Black, Asian, or other race), and insurance type (i.e., private, Medicaid managed care, and Medicare Advantage). Ethnicity was only available for 39% of persons and was not included in the primary analyses. Medicaid treatment restrictions were defined as state Medicaid programs imposing any of three restrictions before authorization of DAA treatment: presence of liver fibrosis meeting fibrosis stage criteria, mandated sobriety or abstinence from alcohol or drugs (≥1 month), or requirement for prescription by or in consultation with a specialist. State-level Medicaid treatment restrictions data were obtained from HepVu,** an online platform used to visualize data and disseminate information on the U.S. hepatitis epidemic. State-level restriction was defined as the presence of one or more restrictions at the time of patient index HCV RNA–positive test date. Data were excluded from this analysis for persons who had positive HCV RNA test results but were missing sex, age, or state of residence (0.4%). 

DAA treatment initiation was assessed using point estimates and 95% CIs; a Wald chi-square test of independence was used to compare baseline characteristics by treatment status. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to quantify the association between the covariates and HCV DAA treatment, adjusting for sex, age group, race, insurance type, and Medicaid treatment restrictions status; aORs and 95% CIs were calculated with p<0.05 considered statistically significant. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess potential effects of missing ethnicity data, alternative codings for race, and impact of state Medicaid treatment restrictions. Analyses were conducted using Azure Databricks (web version; Databricks) and RStudio (version 4.1; RStudio).

During January 30, 2019–October 31, 2020, among 81,913 persons who had at least one positive HCV RNA test result, 47,687 (58%) met inclusion criteria (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/119619). Medicaid managed care covered 37,877 (79%) persons who had a positive HCV RNA test result (Table 1). DAA treatment initiation within 360 days of receipt of a positive HCV RNA test result among persons continuously enrolled in Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance was 23%, 28%, and 35%, respectively (Figure 1). Among patients who received treatment, 84% of private insurance recipients initiated DAA treatment within 180 days of index HCV RNA–positive test date, compared with 75% of Medicaid and 77% of Medicare recipients. 

Comparison of DAA treatment initiation by age group and insurance type showed that treatment initiation prevalence was lower among both Medicaid and private insurance recipients aged 18–29 years (17% and 23%, respectively), compared with that among these recipients aged 50–59 years (28% and 42%, respectively) (Figure 2). Compared by insurance type, the odds of DAA treatment initiation were lowest among persons aged 18–29 and 30–39 years with Medicaid (aOR = 0.52 and 0.68, respectively) and among the same age groups for those with private insurance (0.42 and 0.62, respectively), and those aged 30–39 years with Medicare (0.56), compared with persons aged 50–59 years (Table 2). 

Assessment of DAA treatment initiation by race and insurance type found that among Medicaid recipients, treatment initiation was lowest among persons of other races (20%) and those missing race information (19%) (Figure 2). Among private insurance recipients, treatment initiation was higher in all race groups, but was lowest among persons with missing race information (32%). In adjusted analyses, DAA treatment initiation was similar across most racial groups, except persons with missing race information, who had a lower prevalence of DAA treatment initiation relative to White persons for all insurance types (Table 2). In addition, both Medicaid recipients who reported Black or other race had lower prevalences of treatment initiation relative to White Medicaid recipients (aOR = 0.93 and 0.73, respectively); among Medicare recipients, Asian persons had higher rates of treatment initiation relative to White persons (aOR = 1.56). Male sex was consistently associated with lower treatment initiation among Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance recipients (aOR = 0.85, 0.79, and 0.90, respectively). 

In a model including variables for sex, age group, race, and insurance type, persons with hepatitis C with Medicaid and Medicare had lower odds of initiating DAA treatment than did those with private insurance (aOR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.51–0.57 and aOR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.56–0.68, respectively). Among Medicaid recipients, persons in states with Medicaid treatment restrictions had lower odds of receiving treatment than did those living in states without restrictions (aOR = 0.77). 

","Among adults aged 18–69 years with diagnosed HCV infection and continuous insurance coverage, approximately one third of those with private insurance and one quarter of Medicaid and Medicare recipients initiated DAA treatment within 360 days of diagnosis. Highly effective DAA treatment is recommended for persons with hepatitis C (4) and is curative in ≥95% of cases. Treatment saves lives, prevents ongoing transmission, and is cost saving (5–8), yet too few persons are receiving timely treatment (8,12–14), which could lead to both further progression of disease for the person infected with HCV as well as ongoing transmission to other persons. 

Medicaid and Medicare recipients with hepatitis C were 46% and 38% less likely, respectively, to receive timely treatment compared with those with private insurance. Further, Medicaid recipients with diagnosed hepatitis C in states with Medicaid treatment restrictions were 23% less likely to receive timely treatment than were those living in states without restrictions. Medicare provides health insurance for persons aged ≥65 years living in the United States and persons with disabilities, and Medicaid provides health insurance for eligible adults and children in low-income households. Persons with low income experience social determinants of health that lead to negative health outcomes, including delays in timely treatment for health conditions (14). In general, Medicaid recipients have fewer financial resources and are more likely to be affected by social determinants of health, which further increases the likelihood of negative health outcomes associated with hepatitis C (11). 

Although marketplace competition has reduced the net cost of DAAs, in 2014 initial costs for a course of all oral treatments exceeded $90,000, resulting in many insurers establishing restrictions to access (14). Current costs are considerably lower; however, Medicaid remains the least likely insurer to cover hepatitis C treatment. Treating all eligible patients without restriction would result in substantially reducing downstream negative clinical outcomes, decreasing the proportion of total costs attributable to future care, and producing considerable cost savings (14). Further, whereas hepatitis C treatment eligibility restrictions have become less stringent in some states, others maintain limitations on access to DAAs, including liver fibrosis qualifications, sobriety requirements, or medical subspecialist prescribing requirements. Removing these eligibility restrictions is necessary, but not sufficient. Addressing other barriers, including burdensome preauthorization requirements as well as integrating routine screening and treatment into primary care and other settings where persons with hepatitis C receive services, could also increase treatment coverage (15–17). 

DAA treatment initiation was lowest among adults aged 18–29 and 30–39 years. These groups also have the highest rates of incident HCV infection, often in association with injection drug use, and the largest number of newly reported chronic infections (2). Early hepatitis C treatment prevents disease progression, limits future morbidity and mortality, and reduces health care costs by preventing cases of cirrhosis, liver transplantations, and hepatocellular carcinoma (12–14). Treatment of persons with ongoing transmission risk has important benefits beyond those to the person infected because with each successfully treated person, the number of persons able to transmit disease declines (6). 

Medicaid recipients of other races were up to 27% less likely to initiate timely DAA treatment than White Medicaid recipients. The reasons for racial disparities in treatment initiation among continuously enrolled Medicaid recipients are unclear but might involve health system barriers associated with patient access, provider availability, quality of care, patient distrust, stigma, or language and cultural factors (18,19). The provision of culturally competent and timely hepatitis C treatment for racial and ethnic minority groups is essential to reducing existing disparities in hepatitis C–associated outcomes, including higher mortality among American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black, and Hispanic or Latino persons (8.63, 5.44, and 3.84 per 100,000 population, respectively) compared with that among White persons (3.08) (2,11,16,19). 

Across insurance types, ≥75% of persons treated initiated treatment within 180 days after diagnosis. The smaller percentage of persons treated within 180 days after diagnosis might indicate lack of access to a hepatitis C treatment provider, insurance denial, or loss to follow-up. Treatment coverage can be increased by providing integrated care, patient navigation, and care coordination (15). The introduction of simplified hepatitis C treatment algorithms reducing the number of laboratory tests and in-person visits can facilitate patient-centered treatment (20). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, HealthVerity data might not be representative of DAA treatment patterns across the United States because of the sample characteristics of the payors and providers for whom they process data. Second, information on patients who are uninsured or incarcerated were not included; in addition, these data do not include persons who received care through the Veterans Health Administration. Third, the analytic cohort was conservatively defined, only including persons continuously enrolled for ≥60 days before and ≥360 days after the date of the positive index HCV RNA test result, which likely overestimates treatment initiation among all persons with hepatitis C HCV infection. Fourth, ethnicity data were missing for 61%, and race data for 13%, of the analytic cohort, which prevented examination of other potential treatment disparities. Finally, these data do not allow determination of whether absence of claims for treatment was the result of patient nonadherence, clinicians not prescribing DAAs, insurance providers not authorizing treatment, or prohibitive costs associated with copayments and deductibles. Further studies are needed to understand these barriers better. 

Interventions to increase access to hepatitis C treatment with DAA agents include removing policies limiting patient eligibility based on fibrosis stage or sobriety, requiring treatment through specialists, and requirement for preauthorization (11,17). Universal hepatitis C screening coupled with simplified treatment protocols should be integrated into primary care and other settings serving persons with hepatitis C, and the number of primary care providers treating hepatitis C expanded, especially Medicaid providers serving populations disproportionately affected by hepatitis C. Increasing access to hepatitis C treatment to all populations, regardless of insurance type, is essential to reducing viral hepatitis–related disparities and achieving hepatitis C elimination.","Corresponding author: Carolyn Wester, nhe3@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Thompson WW, Symum H, Sandul A, et al.

COVID-19 self-test use has increased but reporting of results is not required. 

What is added by this report? 

During October 31, 2021–June 11, 2022, 10.7 million test results were voluntarily reported by users of four manufacturers’ self-tests; during that period, 361.9 million laboratory-based and point-of-care test results were reported. Completeness of reporting demographic variables and trends in percent positivity were similar across test types. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Self-tests are a valuable risk-reduction tool that can guide individual actions, but they currently offer limited utility in enhancing public health surveillance. Laboratory-based and point-of-care test result data, in combination with other COVID-19 surveillance information, continue to provide strong situational awareness.

Self-tests* to detect current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are valuable tools that guide individual decision-making and risk reduction† (1–3). Increased self-test use (4) has likely contributed to underascertainment of COVID-19 cases (5–7), because unlike the requirements to report results of laboratory-based and health care provider–administered point-of-care COVID-19 tests,§ public health authorities do not require reporting of self-test results. However, self-test instructions include a recommendation that users report results to their health care provider so that they can receive additional testing and treatment if clinically indicated.¶ In addition, multiple manufacturers of COVID-19 self-tests have developed websites or companion mobile applications for users to voluntarily report self-test result data. Federal agencies use the data reported to manufacturers, in combination with manufacturing supply chain information, to better understand self-test availability and use. This report summarizes data voluntarily reported by users of 10.7 million self-tests from four manufacturers during October 31, 2021–June 11, 2022, and compares these self-test data with data received by CDC for 361.9 million laboratory-based and point-of-care tests performed during the same period. Overall trends in reporting volume and percentage of positive results, as well as completeness of reporting demographic variables, were similar across test types. However, the limited amount and quality of data reported from self-tests currently reduces their capacity to augment existing surveillance. Self-tests provide important risk-reduction information to users, and continued development of infrastructure and methods to collect and analyze data from self-tests could improve their use for surveillance during public health emergencies. 

CDC analyzed COVID-19 self-test result data voluntarily reported by users of tests produced by four manufacturers** to describe available data and related metrics compared with those from COVID-19 laboratory-based and point-of-care nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and point-of-care antigen tests reported by states and territories through the COVID-19 Electronic Laboratory Reporting (CELR) data system.†† Positive NAAT results are considered confirmatory laboratory evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are the main test type used to track national and local community transmission levels (8). Positive point-of-care antigen test results meet the case definition for probable SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used less frequently for national surveillance. Data were analyzed for tests conducted during October 31, 2021–June 11, 2022, to assess the following metrics: 1) weekly testing volume (number of test results reported); 2) 7-day average percentage of positive test results (the number of positive tests reported divided by total tests reported within a 7-day period); and 3) overall completeness of reporting of critical demographic variables (age, sex, and race or ethnicity). CDC does not receive information on patients’ actual name, address, telephone number, or email for test results; however, completeness of self-test obfuscated values (i.e., the fields are coded as having information but the values [e.g., name] are not provided) was able to be assessed based on data obtained during May 25–June 3, 2022.§§ This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶ 

During October 2021–May 2022, the four manufacturers produced 393.4 million self-tests, representing 15.3% of all self-tests produced for the United States during this period.*** During October 31, 2021–June 11, 2022, users voluntarily reported results of 10,673,837 self-tests through the four manufacturers’ websites or companion mobile applications compared with results of 276,257,710 laboratory-based and point-of-care NAATs and 85,670,213 point-of-care antigen tests reported through the CELR system. For all test types, the peak reported test volume occurred during the week ending January 8, 2022 (Figure 1). During the weeks ending November 6, 2021, and April 23, 2022, the volume of reported laboratory-based and point-of-care NAAT results ranged from 1,947 to 14 times that of self-reported test results, respectively. During the same period, trends in percentages of positive test results were similar across test types; the highest percentage of positive laboratory-based and point-of-care NAAT results (29.1%) and self-tests (17.3%) occurred during the week ending January 8, 2022, and for point-of-care antigen tests (19.8%), occurred during the week ending January 1, 2022 (Figure 2). 

During October 31, 2021–June 11, 2022, completeness of reporting of demographic information varied across test types and was similar to, but generally higher for laboratory-based and point-of-care tests than for self-tests (Table). For self-test results reported during May 25–June 3, 2022, obfuscated values (i.e., the fields are coded as having information but the values [e.g., name] are not provided) for the customer’s name (first and last) were included in 24.8% of reported self-test results, address was included in 9.8%, telephone number in 17.2%, and email address in 26.6%.","During October 2021–May 2022, approximately 393 million self-tests were produced by the four manufacturers assessed in this study. Although not all self-tests produced by these manufacturers were distributed, purchased, and used, the 10.7 million results voluntarily reported by users and made available for public health surveillance likely reflect a small fraction of the number of self-tests used. This finding indicates that throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including during the Omicron variant surge period (December 2021–February 2022) covered by this analysis (6,7), underascertainment of cases has occurred (5). Underascertainment might be attributed to multiple factors, including the lack of formal mechanisms to enable reporting of self-test results to public health authorities and persons with mild or no symptoms not seeking testing or health care. 

Self-tests provide another option for persons seeking accessible testing and remain an important tool to guide individual decision-making and risk reduction. Mandating reporting of all self-test results to public health authorities is not practical and could negatively affect acceptability and use of self-tests, which would be detrimental to minimizing disease spread. Although the increase in self-testing (4) might result in underascertainment of total case counts, this analysis indicates that the NAAT data captured via CELR, combined with case data, remain robust and continue to track trends in community transmission.††† In addition, persons with more severe disease are probably more likely to receive a NAAT when seeking care in outpatient or inpatient settings, and national surveillance primarily focuses on these cases. Furthermore, other types of surveillance data provide insights into aspects of disease burden such as demands on health care systems, highly or disproportionately affected populations, and severity indicators. Therefore, even without self-testing result data being formally included in national surveillance efforts, the integrated, whole-of-government surveillance activity for the COVID-19 pandemic§§§ remains strong, incorporating data from various sources, including case surveillance, laboratory testing, syndromic surveillance, genomics testing, hospitalizations, health care use, supply chain capacities, school data, wastewater surveillance, vital statistics, and vaccination. 

Current limitations in self-test data reduce their usefulness to guide public health decision-making. Cases based solely on positive self-test results do not meet national guidance for confirmed or probable cases because self-tests are not administered by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified providers (8). The quality of the specimen, execution of the self-test, result produced, and person tested are unverified in most instances; therefore, reported interpretation of results cannot be confirmed. Moreover, in contrast to NAATs, self-test specimens cannot be submitted for culturing and viral isolate characterization to identify or describe the prevalence of variants. Voluntary reporting is often anonymous and lacks information (e.g., telephone number) necessary for action, including deduplication, case investigation, or contact tracing. Finally, because of the similarity in trends for percentage of positive test results and demographic completeness across test types, self-test results are currently unlikely to enhance the ability to understand disease transmission trends. 

Despite these limitations, public health experts need to continue evaluating self-test data to understand how they can be incorporated into future surveillance models. Additional analyses can explore several factors: how communities are using and reporting self-tests, equitable access to self-tests, what factors drive decisions to report results, and representativeness of findings; how often positive self-test results lead to isolation, pursuit of treatment, or confirmation of result with laboratory-based testing; and to what degree self-testing is replacing testing in more traditional settings. 

Anticipating the potential importance of self-test data for public health and the growing demand to shift testing outside of care and to individual persons, federal agencies have been building relationships with test manufacturers to enable data transmission for public health use. For example, CDC, through partnerships with the U.S. Digital Service, the National Institutes of Health, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories, worked with manufacturers to advise on data to be collected and supported development of data reporting and data transportation capabilities and sharing of self-test data for broad public health use. In addition, the National Institutes of Health, through their RADx Mobile Application Reporting through Standards (MARS) program, is focusing on leveraging data standards to enhance data harmonization, capture, transmission, and reporting for self-tests for clinical and public health use.¶¶¶ Furthermore, certain jurisdictions are leveraging anonymous exposure notification systems that use voluntarily reported test result information, including for self-tests, to notify close contacts of potential COVID-19 exposures. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, self-test data were available from only four manufacturers and from users who voluntarily reported results, representing only approximately 3% of the total self-tests produced by these manufacturers and 0.4% produced by all manufacturers during the period; therefore, these data might not be representative of all self-tests used. Second, data completeness was based on presence of any value and not valid values, and personally identifiable information assessment only captured data for a short period; therefore, estimates provided might not represent overall data quality. 

Established surveillance based on NAAT testing is in place that can monitor trends in the spread and effects of COVID-19 within communities. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, self-tests have become an important public health tool to guide individual decision-making. Persons who use self-tests should be encouraged to report results to their health care providers, who can ensure that they receive additional testing, counselling, and medical care, as clinically indicated. Limitations in currently available self-test data limit their value for present public health COVID-19 surveillance. Continued development of infrastructure and methods to collect and analyze self-test data could improve their value for surveillance purposes during future public health emergencies.","Corresponding author: Matthew D.

A multinational monkeypox outbreak disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men, including persons with HIV infection, is ongoing worldwide. 

What is added by this report? 

CDC has developed clinical considerations for prevention and treatment of monkeypox in persons with HIV infection, including pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis with JYNNEOS vaccine, treatment with tecovirimat, and infection control. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Persons with advanced HIV might be at increased risk for severe monkeypox. Postexposure prophylaxis and antiviral treatments are available for persons with HIV infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment and enhanced prevention efforts might reduce the risk for severe outcomes.

Monkeypox virus, an orthopoxvirus sharing clinical features with smallpox virus, is endemic in several countries in Central and West Africa. The last reported outbreak in the United States, in 2003, was linked to contact with infected prairie dogs that had been housed or transported with African rodents imported from Ghana (1). Since May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported a multinational outbreak of monkeypox centered in Europe and North America, with approximately 25,000 cases reported worldwide; the current outbreak is disproportionately affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) (2). Monkeypox was declared a public health emergency in the United States on August 4, 2022.† Available summary surveillance data from the European Union, England, and the United States indicate that among MSM patients with monkeypox for whom HIV status is known, 28%–51% have HIV infection (3–10). Treatment of monkeypox with tecovirimat as a first-line agent is available through CDC for compassionate use through an investigational drug protocol. No identified drug interactions would preclude coadministration of tecovirimat with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. Pre- and postexposure prophylaxis can be considered with JYNNEOS vaccine, if indicated. Although data are limited for monkeypox in patients with HIV, prompt diagnosis, treatment, and prevention might reduce the risk for adverse outcomes and limit monkeypox spread. Prevention and treatment considerations will be updated as more information becomes available. 

Background 
Signs and Symptoms: Classically, monkeypox occurs in three stages. After an incubation period of approximately 1–2 weeks, a prodrome, characterized by fever and lymphadenopathy occurs, which is followed by the onset of a deep-seated vesicular or pustular rash that often begins centrally and spreads to the limbs (11). Transmission of monkeypox can occur through direct contact with the infectious rash, scabs, or body fluids, through respiratory secretions during prolonged face-to-face contact or intimate physical contact, or through touching items, such as clothing or linens, that previously touched a patient’s infectious rash or body fluids.§ Patients are considered contagious until the scabs have crusted over and fallen off and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed underneath. 

Reports from the current outbreak suggest transmission patterns and clinical manifestations might not follow the classic presentation of monkeypox (5–10). Although any person can acquire monkeypox, epidemiologic data indicate that transmission is currently most intense among interconnected networks of sexually active MSM, with transmission occurring primarily through intimate skin-to-skin contact during sex (6). Prodrome or systemic symptoms do not always occur or precede the rash. Mucosal involvement occurs in approximately 40% of cases, including genital, perianal, and oropharyngeal lesions (5). Genital and perianal lesions can be associated with severe and painful proctitis, urethritis, phimosis, and balanitis. Oropharyngeal symptoms, including symptoms resulting from tonsillitis and epiglottitis, can be associated with pain or difficulty swallowing. 

Treatment: There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved treatments for monkeypox. However, drugs that are approved for treatment of smallpox and cytomegalovirus might have activity against Monkeypox virus. Tecovirimat is an antiviral medication available in oral and intravenous formulations. Animal studies have shown that tecovirimat is effective in treating orthopoxvirus-induced disease (12). Data are not available on the effectiveness of tecovirimat in treating monkeypox in humans; however, a case report from the United Kingdom suggested that tecovirimat might shorten the duration of illness and of viral shedding (13). Human clinical trials indicate that the drug is safe and tolerable with only minor side effects (14). Randomized controlled trials in humans are underway to further assess safety as well as efficacy in treating monkeypox. Tecovirimat is available from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and is administered under an expanded access (i.e., compassionate use) Investigational New Drug (EA-IND) protocol held by CDC.¶ 

Other treatments that can be considered in severe cases include vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV), cidofovir, and brincidofovir. Cidofovir and brincidofovir have proven activity against poxviruses in in vitro and animal studies, but only cidofovir is currently available either commercially or from the SNS. VIGIV is available from the SNS and is administered under an EA-IND protocol for monkeypox. At this time, it is unknown whether a person with severe monkeypox will benefit from treatment with VIGIV, cidofovir, or brincidofovir because effectiveness data are not available. 

Pre- and Postexposure Prophylaxis: The only form of pre-exposure prophylaxis available or authorized for monkeypox is vaccination, which currently is recommended for persons at risk for occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses, such as laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for Monkeypox virus and members of health care worker response teams designated by appropriate public health and antiterror authorities (15). Routine immunization of all health care workers against smallpox or monkeypox is not currently recommended.** 

Postexposure prophylaxis can be considered after exposure to monkeypox.†† Although the use of smallpox vaccines for postexposure prophylaxis has not been studied in the context of monkeypox outbreaks, early administration of vaccines (≤4 days after exposure) might prevent monkeypox, and later use (5–14 days after exposure) might decrease the severity of monkeypox if infection occurs (16,17). Vaccination given after the onset of signs or symptoms of monkeypox is not expected to provide benefit.§§ 

Two vaccines are licensed by FDA for the prevention of orthopoxvirus infections. JYNNEOS is a live virus vaccine that uses nonreplicating modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) which is licensed for prevention of smallpox and monkeypox in adults aged ≥18 years (18). Because JYNNEOS contains replication-deficient MVA, it does not present a risk for disseminated infection, autoinoculation, or transmission to others (15). JYNNEOS vaccine is administered as a series of two doses given 28 days apart (18). ACAM2000 is a replication-competent live vaccinia virus vaccine licensed for prevention of smallpox that is administered as a single dose (19). ACAM2000 was derived from Dryvax, the vaccine used in the eradication of smallpox (19). 

Monkeypox in Persons with HIV Infection 
Clinical Presentation and Outcomes: It is currently not known whether HIV infection affects a person’s risk for acquiring monkeypox. MSM with HIV infection are at present disproportionately represented among monkeypox cases. However, ascertaining the relative roles that exposure and biologic risks play in this disproportionality is challenging. Sexual behavior that confers risk for HIV acquisition also increases risk for acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) leading to a similar disproportionate overrepresentation of MSM with HIV among STI cases (20); risk for monkeypox through sexual contact is likely similarly increased. Although it is possible that poorly controlled HIV would increase risk for monkeypox after exposure, evidence from other diseases suggests that persons with HIV infection who are receiving ART and have robust CD4 counts are not at increased risk for most infections, including opportunistic infections, and therefore might not be at increased risk for monkeypox after exposure.¶¶ 

Available data indicate that persons with advanced and uncontrolled HIV infection might be at higher risk for severe or prolonged monkeypox disease following infection. In a 2017–2018 case series describing 122 Nigerian patients with monkeypox caused by the same strain responsible for the current outbreak, four of the seven deaths occurred among persons with untreated advanced HIV infection; however, information about the overall proportion of patients with HIV infection was not available, precluding the ability to determine whether this mortality was disproportionately large (21). A second 2017–2018 series of 40 monkeypox cases, also from Nigeria, included nine persons with HIV infection for whom clinical data relevant to HIV status were provided; CD4 cell counts ranged from 20 to 357 per μL, and most patients had either failed ART or had newly diagnosed HIV infection, suggesting a lack of viral suppression. Two of nine patients with HIV in that case series died. Compared with other patients with monkeypox, those with HIV infection had higher rates of secondary bacterial infection, more prolonged illness (and thereby also longer period of infectiousness), as well as a higher likelihood of having a confluent or partially confluent rash rather than discrete lesions (22). In contrast, recent reports from European countries where most patients are receiving effective ART have noted no deaths or evident excess in hospitalizations among persons with HIV infection and monkeypox to date (3,4,6). In addition, WHO has stated that a more severe disease course has not been reported in persons with HIV infection who are receiving ART and have a robust immune system (23), a finding supported by recent large cohort studies (5,7,8). 

Management of patients with HIV infection and monkeypox: ART and opportunistic infection prophylaxis should be continued in all persons with HIV infection who acquire monkeypox (Table 1). Treatment interruption might lead to rebound HIV viremia that could complicate the management of monkeypox, including worsening illness severity.*** Persons receiving ART for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis or postexposure prophylaxis should likewise continue taking these medications. Persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection at the time of monkeypox diagnosis should commence ART as soon as possible, in consultation with an expert in HIV care, if needed. Monkeypox diagnosis has been reported concurrent with diagnosis of acute HIV infection and other STIs, highlighting the importance of testing for these infections when monkeypox is suspected or diagnosed (24). 

Treatment of monkeypox should be considered among persons with HIV infection, taking into account disease severity, degree of immunosuppression, or vulnerable sites of infection (e.g., the genitals or anus).††† Tecovirimat is the first-line medication recommended for treatment of monkeypox, including among persons with HIV infection. Clinically relevant interactions among tecovirimat, cidofovir, and brincidofovir and certain ARTs are known and should be considered when selecting treatment (Table 2). However, none of the identified drug interactions should preclude coadministration of tecovirimat and antiretroviral therapy. Cidofovir is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL because of the associated nephrotoxicity. There are no specific contraindications for use of VIGIV among persons with HIV infection. 

Considerations for vaccination: The safety and immunogenicity of JYNNEOS have been specifically evaluated in persons with HIV infection. Clinical trials demonstrate that JYNNEOS is well-tolerated with similar immunogenicity and rates of adverse events in persons with HIV infection with CD4 cell counts of 200–750 per μL and persons without HIV infection (25,26). In persons with HIV infection with a prior diagnosis of AIDS who were virologically suppressed and had CD4 counts of 100–500 per μL, there were no serious safety concerns and the vaccine appeared efficacious based on immunogenicity at standard dosing (27). However, immunogenicity among persons with HIV infection who have CD4 cell counts <100 per μL or who are not virologically suppressed is not known. 

Because ACAM2000 contains a replication-competent, attenuated strain of vaccinia virus, severe localized or systemic complications of ACAM2000 (e.g., progressive vaccinia) can occur in persons with weakened immune systems, including from HIV infection (15). 

Interim Guidance 
Providers should consider both viral suppression and CD4 count in weighing the risk for severe monkeypox-associated outcomes for any patient with HIV infection. Although severe outcomes have been observed in persons with inadequately treated HIV infection who have CD4 counts ≤350 per μL and are likely not virologically suppressed, currently available data are insufficient to define actionable thresholds (21,22). Until more is known, clinicians should exercise clinical judgement assessing the extent of immunosuppression from HIV and from any other sources, and the relationship of the patient’s immunosuppression to the risk for severe monkeypox illness. 

When vaccination is used for prevention of monkeypox in persons with HIV infection, JYNNEOS is preferred over ACAM2000. Based on current recommendations from ACIP, ACAM2000 is contraindicated for persons with HIV infection because of the risk for severe adverse effects resulting from the spread of vaccinia virus (15). If high-risk exposures cannot be avoided, immunocompromised persons may receive JYNNEOS in consultation with their health care provider after careful consideration of the risks and benefits (15). Clinical efficacy (vaccine effectiveness) of JYNNEOS against monkeypox is unknown, including among persons with HIV infection. Other therapies, including tecovirimat and VIGIV, can be considered for monkeypox postexposure prophylaxis on an individual case-by-case basis, in cases of known high-risk exposure to a confirmed or probable case of infection and clinical conditions that necessitate an alternative option to postexposure vaccination, such as advanced HIV. The efficacy of these therapies as monkeypox postexposure prophylaxis is unknown. 

Persons with and without HIV infection should follow the same guidance to protect themselves from monkeypox. Primary prevention of monkeypox includes isolating persons with infection from other persons and their pets, avoiding close contact and sexual activity (including oral, anal, and vaginal sex or sharing of sex toys) with persons with infection, and postexposure vaccination. Persons identified as close contacts of persons with monkeypox should follow any additional guidance from their state or local health department. 

",Persons with advanced HIV infection or who are not virologically suppressed with ART might be at increased risk for severe disease related to monkeypox. Postexposure prophylaxis and antiviral treatments are available for persons exposed to Monkeypox virus or with monkeypox. Vaccination with JYNNEOS is considered safe for persons with HIV infection. Drug interactions between ART and tecovirimat do not preclude coadministration if antiviral therapy for monkeypox is indicated. Prevention and treatment considerations will be updated as more information becomes available.,"Corresponding Author: Jesse O’Shea, kst4@cdc.gov, 678-475-4899.","Suggested citation for this article: O’Shea J, Filardo TD, Morris SB, Weiser J, Petersen B, Brooks JT.

In late 2021, during the surge in Omicron BA.1 variant cases, state§ and federal¶ authorities expanded access to self-administered, at-home rapid antigen tests, which can increase a person’s knowledge of their COVID-19 status and guide risk-reduction behaviors. New York government agencies sent millions of these tests to schools for distribution to teachers, students, and staff members. Because results of self-administered, at-home tests are not captured by electronic laboratory reporting (in contrast to health care provider–administered tests at a physician’s office or laboratory that are reported through electronic health records or other means), expanded use of these tests might affect interpretation of trends in reported COVID-19 cases; however, this has yet to be assessed** (2). Furthermore, understanding changes in testing behavior before and after the Omicron variant surge might help public health officials better use available COVID-19 data to guide future policy. 

COVID-19 case data from two independently operating New York State Department of Health systems were compared before and after expansion of at-home testing: 1) laboratory-reported data†† for children and adolescents aged 5–17 years and 2) a kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12) school-based system§§ for reporting positive results from all testing sources¶¶ (3). Laboratory-reported data include results of school-administered tests (which are required to be reported) but exclude results from self-administered, at-home tests. School-reported data include positive results reported to the state from any test source, including those from clinical settings, school-based testing programs, and self-administered, at-home tests. Case totals for both data sets*** and the ratio of school-reported to laboratory-reported cases were calculated weekly during September 11, 2021–April 29, 2022, and compared. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††† 

During the September 11–17, 2021, school week, among 6,928 New York schools, 5,201 (75.1%) reported to the school-based system; by the April 23–29, 2022, school week, 5,274 (76.1%) schools reported (weekly median = 80.7%; IQR = 76.1%–81.7%). During the entire analysis period, 477,538 student cases were reported to the K–12 school-based system, and 464,421 cases in children and adolescents aged 5–17 years were reported by laboratories§§§; the overall ratio of school-reported to laboratory-reported cases was 1.03. During September 11–December 31, 2021, the ratio of school-reported to laboratory-reported cases was stable and near 1.0 (median = 0.82; IQR = 0.73–0.85) (Figure). From the January 1–7 to the April 29, 2022, school week, during and following state and federal expansion of at-home testing, the ratio of school-reported to laboratory-reported cases increased 167%, from 1.36 to 3.64 (median = 1.58; IQR = 1.36–2.13). 

These findings are subject to at least three limitations. First, because school-reported data include some students aged <5 years or >17 years, and not all children and adolescents aged 5–17 years attend schools that reported cases, school-reported and laboratory-reported case data were not directly comparable. Second, these results might reflect both underreporting of infection and increased detection because of at-home test use. Finally, results from school-aged children and adolescents are not representative of those from the general population. 

The changing relationship between school-reported and laboratory-reported data, during a period of stable school reporting, suggests a decline in the capture of positive laboratory test result data for children and adolescents aged 5–17 years following the expansion of at-home testing. Throughout the pandemic, public health programs have relied on laboratory-reported data to guide risk communication; underestimation of cases based on these data could affect interpretations of epidemic trends and metrics derived from them, including community COVID-19 incidence. This analysis suggests that methods of capturing data on results from self-administered, at-home tests can augment laboratory-reported data to provide a more complete picture of positive COVID-19 test results within communities. Jurisdictions that prioritize both at-home COVID-19 testing and comprehensive epidemiologic monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic might consider implementing reporting systems that operate alongside electronic laboratory reporting. As the pandemic has evolved, however, the level of vaccine- and infection-derived immunity has increased in the population; thus, prioritization of reducing medically significant illness and minimizing strain on the health care system has increased.¶¶¶ Health officials and the public should consider current information about COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in the community, as well as the potential for strain on the local health system, when making decisions about community prevention strategies and individual behaviors.****",N/A,"Corresponding author: Travis T.

Splash pads jet or spray water on users. 

What is added by this report? 

Two outbreaks were associated with a Kansas wildlife park: one caused by Shigella and involving 21 cases in study respondents who visited on June 11 and the other caused by norovirus and involving six cases in respondents who visited on June 18. Getting splash pad water in the mouth was associated with illness on both days. Outbreak contributing factors included inadequate disinfection, equipment, and training. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Maintaining adequate water disinfection and environmental health expertise and targeting prevention efforts to caregivers of children help prevent splash pad–associated outbreaks.

In June 2021, Kansas state and county public health officials identified and investigated three cases of shigellosis (a bacterial diarrheal illness caused by Shigella spp.) associated with visiting a wildlife park. The park has animal exhibits and a splash pad. Two affected persons visited animal exhibits, and all three entered the splash pad. Nonhuman primates are the only known animal reservoir of Shigella. The splash pad, which sprays water on users and is designed so that water does not collect in the user area, was closed on June 19. The state and county public health codes do not include regulations for splash pads. Thus, these venues are not typically inspected, and environmental health expertise is limited. A case-control study identified two distinct outbreaks associated with the park (a shigellosis outbreak involving 21 cases and a subsequent norovirus infection outbreak involving six cases). Shigella and norovirus can be transmitted by contaminated water; in both outbreaks, illness was associated with getting splash pad water in the mouth (multiply imputed adjusted odds ratio [aORMI] = 6.4, p = 0.036; and 28.6, p = 0.006, respectively). Maintaining adequate water disinfection and environmental health expertise and targeting prevention efforts to caregivers of splash pad users help prevent splash pad–associated outbreaks. Outbreak incidence might be further reduced when U.S. jurisdicitons voluntarily adopt CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) recommendations and through the prevention messages: “Don’t get in the water if sick with diarrhea,” “Don’t stand or sit above the jets,” and “Don’t swallow the water.”† 

On June 18, 2021, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) notified CDC of three cases of shigellosis associated with visiting the wildlife park. Because splash pads are not typically regulated, and thus not inspected, the capacity to identify factors contributing to outbreaks associated with such venues is also limited. KDHE and Sedgwick County Health Department (SCHD) consulted with CDC on the outbreak investigation, which included a case-control study that identified 21 shigellosis cases in respondents who visited the wildlife park on June 11 and six norovirus infection cases in respondents who visited the park 1 week later, on June 18. 


Clinical Laboratory and Epidemiologic Investigation 
In Kansas, shigellosis is reportable, and patients are interviewed using standard case investigation forms. The initial investigation identified eight patients with shigellosis who reported entering the splash pad on June 11 and who all experienced signs and symptoms 12–73 hours later. Two of the eight patients had stool cultures positive for Shigella flexneri type 1; whole genome sequencing found no base pair differences between the two isolates. The remaining six patients had stool specimens tested using multiplex polymerase chain reaction and were positive for the Shigella/enteroinvasive Escherichia coli target (ipaH gene). Two of these six patients also had specimens that tested positive for the Shiga toxin target (stx1/stx2 genes); however, neither stool culture yielded Shiga toxin–producing E. coli. 

KDHE and the wildlife park, through press releases and Facebook posts, encouraged patrons who visited the park during the period from the seasonal opening day (May 28) through June 19 to voluntarily complete an online outbreak questionnaire during July 12–August 4. The questionnaire requested information on demographic characteristics, activities during wildlife park visits, and signs and symptoms of respondents who experienced gastrointestinal illness (case-patients). Participants who did not experience gastrointestinal illness were considered control respondents. 

Summary statistics and bivariate analyses assessed potential exposures. Where item nonresponse was present, missing values were multiply imputed§ (1,2). Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and CIs were estimated using Firth penalized maximum likelihood logistic regression (3), which can mitigate bias due to rare events. Multiply imputed analyses were compared with complete case analyses. All statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 4.1.3, R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶ 

Analysis of data from 404 respondents who only visited the park once during May 28–June 19 identified two distinct outbreaks (Figure 1). Among 72 respondents** who visited on June 11, 21 (29%) experienced illness meeting the shigellosis case definition (three or more loose stools in 24 hours with onset 12–73 hours after visiting the wildlife park on June 11). The median ages of shigellosis case-patients and controls†† were 5 years (range = 1–15 years) and 11 years (range = 1–70 years), respectively (p<0.01).§§ Both case-patients and controls were predominantly female (62% and 67%, respectively). Playing in the splash pad water was not associated with illness; however, getting splash pad water in the mouth was associated with illness (multivariate complete case adjusted odds ratio [aORC] = 10.2, p = 0.007; aORMI = 6.4, p = 0.036) (Table) (Figure 2). Touching or feeding lemurs (the only nonhuman primates available for patron interaction) was not associated with illness. Three case-patients were hospitalized for an average of 3 days; no deaths were reported. 

Among 27 respondents¶¶ who visited the wildlife park on June 18, six (22%) experienced illness meeting the norovirus infection case definition (vomiting or three or more loose stools in 24 hours with onset 12–56 hours after visiting the wildlife park on June 18). Responses for three case-patients indicated a health care provider diagnosed norovirus infection. The median ages of norovirus infection case-patients and controls*** were 5 years (range = 1–38 years) and 20 years (range = 3–63 years), respectively (p = 0.04). Case-patients and controls were predominantly female (83% and 68%, respectively). All six case-patients played in the splash pad water and got the splash pad water in their mouths (Figure 2). Getting splash pad water in the mouth was associated with illness (aORC = 24.1, p = 0.007; aORMI = 28.6, p = 0.006). One case-patient was hospitalized for 1 day; no deaths were reported. 


Environmental Microbiology Laboratory and Environmental Health Investigation 
The wildlife park’s unregulated splash pad included jets, tipping buckets, and slides. SCHD worked with the splash pad operator and CDC to identify potential factors contributing to the outbreaks. Water stood in the collection tank (into which water drains after spraying users and before it is filtered, disinfected, and resprayed) overnight instead of being continuously recirculated, filtered, and chlorinated. The splash pad did not have an automated controller to measure and help maintain the free chlorine concentration needed to prevent pathogen transmission. In addition, no staff member had documentation of having completed standardized operator training. Splash pad water samples were collected on June 19 from the four sand filters, seven pumps, and collection tank. CDC tested the samples for Shigella and fecal indicator bacteria.††† Total coliforms were detected in three of the seven pumps feeding the splash pad features; E. coli was detected in one of the coliform-positive pumps. 


Public Health Response 
After the splash pad was closed, CDC drafted operation and management guidance for reopening, based on the 2018 MAHC (4). SCHD finalized the recommendations and shared them with the splash pad operator. On July 24, the operator reopened the splash pad to the public after voluntarily addressing gaps and implementing best practices, including continuously recirculating, filtering, and disinfecting water (MAHC 5.7.1.1.1 and 5.7.3.1);§§§ using an automated controller (MAHC 5.7.3.7.1); and completing operator training (MAHC 6.1.2). After these interventions were implemented, no additional splash pad–associated illnesses were identified.","Pathogens that cause gastrointestinal illness can be transmitted when water contaminated with feces from infected persons is ingested. Splash pads are intended for young children, aged <5 years. Young children are more likely to experience acute gastrointestinal illness including shigellosis and norovirus infection (5,6), and, because of inadequate toileting and hygiene skills, are more likely to contaminate the water. Swim diapers do not prevent contamination of water (7). Children also ingest more recreational water than do adults (8). One study of splash pad behaviors documented children wearing diapers, sitting on water jets, and placing their open mouths to the water (9). When splash pads jet or spray water, aerosolization depletes the free chlorine concentration, making it more difficult to maintain the minimum concentration necessary to prevent pathogen transmission. These two splash pad outbreaks were caused by pathogens readily inactivated by free chlorine,¶¶¶ indicating that the outbreaks might have been prevented by maintaining water disinfection. The environmental health investigation findings elucidated why these outbreaks occurred; no additional cases were identified after the operator implemented reopening guidance, suggesting that pathogen transmission can be prevented. 

Splash pads typically do not have standing water in the user area. Thus, they might not meet a jurisdiction’s definition of a treated recreational water venue (e.g., pool) open to the public, which can exempt them from regulation under public health codes. In 1997, the first reported splash pad–associated outbreak also occurred near animals**** (10). Although neither the investigation of the 1997 outbreak nor this shigellosis outbreak found evidence of waterborne zoonotic pathogen transmission, they highlight the potential for such transmission. In public animal settings with splash pads, using the splash pad before entering animal areas or changing shoes before entering the splash pad could prevent the introduction and transmission of zoonotic pathogens. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, daily overall wildlife park and splash pad patron counts were not available, and respondent representativeness was not assessed. Second, case-patient and control respondent counts were small, and analyzing data by wildlife park visit date further limited statistical power. However, for visit dates other than June 11 or 18, no case-patients had clinical laboratory evidence supporting detection of the same pathogen. Missing data were multiply imputed to partially address limited statistical power. Third, wording of one response choice lacked clarity†††† and might have increased error in exposure observations resulting in increased SE and reduced significance in the association between the splash pad and illness. Fourth, small samples can cause rare events to be overrepresented, leading to bias. Statistical techniques, including Firth penalized logistic regression, were employed to account for this. Finally, the time elapsed from splash pad entry until study response could have led to recall bias. 

By identifying factors contributing to outbreaks, environmental health specialists provide data central to developing effective mitigation and prevention strategies for outbreaks associated with treated recreational water venues open to the public. As splash pad use increases, exempting splash pads from regulation under public health codes needs to be reconsidered. CDC’s MAHC recommendations can be voluntarily adopted by U.S. jurisdictions. Environmental health specialists also enforce public health codes through inspections and serve as healthy and safe swimming resources for operators.§§§§ To further promote healthy and safe swimming, environmental health specialists can partner with the aquatics sector to engage the public and increase awareness of the importance of healthy swimming steps. Efforts to prevent splash pad–associated outbreaks need to be targeted to caregivers, with prevention messages that include “Don’t get in the water if sick with diarrhea,” “Don’t stand or sit above the jets,” and “Don’t swallow the water.”

Synthetic cathinones have been sold as MDMA (1), distributed as nondrug products (e.g., bath salts) to conceal their sale as an illicit drug and also sold as illicit drug products.* From 2017 to 2021, the supply of eutylone† (a synthetic cathinone) rapidly increased in the United States. During January–June 2017, eutylone was detected in fewer than 10 drug items such as powders, capsules, or tablets obtained through law enforcement activities such as drug seizures, arrests, or undercover buys and tested; during January–June 2021, eutylone was detected in 8,379 drug items, making it the seventh most identified drug during this period (2). Public alerts have been issued and include concern about elevated overdose risk associated with eutylone being sold as MDMA§ (1). Little is known about the relative potencies and pharmacological profile of synthetic cathinones compared with MDMA, and using counterfeit tablets potentially increases the risk for overdose; however, additional investigation is needed. 

CDC, through the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS), funds 47 states and the District of Columbia¶ to enhance postmortem toxicology testing and abstract comprehensive data from death certificates and medical examiner or coroner reports, including toxicology reports, for drug overdose deaths of unintentional and undetermined intent. This report describes overdose deaths in which the medical examiner or coroner determined that eutylone contributed to the death (eutylone-involved deaths), submitted to SUDORS by 43 states and the District of Columbia with data for January–June 2020, July–December 2020, or both.** For three states (Alabama, South Carolina, and Wisconsin), data from the death certificate only were analyzed. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† 

During 2020, 343 eutylone-involved deaths were reported by 22 of 44 SUDORS jurisdictions, with 259 (75.5%) concentrated in two southern states§§ (Florida [182] and Maryland [77]). Eutylone-involved deaths commonly co-involved illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs)¶¶ (which include both illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs) (77.3%), and cocaine or methamphetamine (53.1%) (Table). Among 183 (53.4%) of 343 eutylone-involved deaths with medical examiner or coroner reports available (from 41 of 44 jurisdictions),*** 23 (12.6%) had negative MDMA toxicology findings but evidence of MDMA use before the overdose or a history of MDMA use.††† One of the 23 deaths was in a person who had a history of cathinone use. 

In 2020, most eutylone-involved deaths occurred within two states in the South, the region with the most eutylone drug reports by law enforcement in both 2019 and 2020 (2). Rapid increases in drug products containing eutylone (2), coupled with the concentration of eutylone-involved deaths in a few states, warrant enhanced surveillance for new outbreaks in other states involving emerging or known synthetic cathinones, including eutylone. Starting in late 2021, the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Drug Dependence reviewed and then recommended legally regulating the international distribution of eutylone; subsequently, the United Nations Commission on Narcotics Drugs internationally scheduled eutylone with enforcement beginning on November 23, 2022.§§§ International scheduling of eutylone might be contributing to its replacement with a newer synthetic cathinone with sharp increases in N,N-dimethylpentylone and declines in eutylone reported in 2022.¶¶¶ 

Understanding whether eutylone exposure is intended or unintended (i.e., via adulterated substances) can guide prevention efforts. Consistent with previously reported unintentional exposure among persons using MDMA (1), approximately one in 10 eutylone-involved deaths in this report had evidence of current or past MDMA use but no toxicology finding of MDMA. Common co-involvement of IMFs in eutylone-involved deaths is consistent with the increased prevalence of concurrent use of IMFs with illicit stimulants (3). However, infrequent documentation of purposeful cathinone use in eutylone-involved deaths might indicate unintended exposures and needs further investigation. One half of eutylone-involved deaths co-involved cocaine or methamphetamine, which heightens fatal overdose risk because of the cumulative effects of multiple stimulants. This high level of co-involvement could be related to unintentional exposure or part of an increasing trend to co-use multiple stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine (4). Risk for unintentional eutylone exposure might be mitigated by 1) increasing knowledge about synthetic cathinones, including eutylone, among persons using MDMA and other drugs with eutylone, 2) supporting rapid dissemination of results from enhanced toxicology testing of illicit drug products, including those sold as MDMA, and 3) broadly increasing availability and access to harm reduction strategies.",N/A,"Corresponding author: R.

Among youths aged 14–17 years, suicide and homicide are the second and third leading causes of death, respectively. Most youth homicides result from firearm injuries; firearms are the most common method of youth suicide. 

What is added by this report? 

Using a new measure that excludes recreational gun carrying, one in 15 male and one in 50 female high school students reported carrying a gun for nonrecreational purposes at least once during the preceding 12 months. Gun carrying was more prevalent among those who experienced violence, suicidal ideation or attempts, or substance use. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Comprehensive strategies using the best available evidence including addressing youth substance use and gun carrying can prevent youth violence and suicide.

Suicide and homicide are the second and third leading causes of death, respectively, among youths aged 14–17 years (1); nearly one half (46%) of youth suicides and most (93%) youth homicides result from firearm injuries (1). Understanding youth gun carrying and associated outcomes can guide prevention initiatives (2). This study used the updated measure of gun carrying in the 2017 and 2019 administrations of CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey* (YRBS) to describe the national prevalence of gun carrying for reasons other than hunting or sport among high school students aged <18 years and to examine the associations between gun carrying and experiencing violence, suicidal ideation or attempts, or substance use. Gun carrying during the previous 12 months was reported by one in 15 males and one in 50 females. Gun carrying was significantly more likely among youths with violence-related experiences (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] range = 1.5–10.1), suicidal ideation or attempts (aPR range = 1.8–3.5), or substance use (aPR range = 4.2–5.6). These results underscore the importance of comprehensive approaches to preventing youth violence and suicide, including strategies that focus on preventing youth substance use and gun carrying (3). 

CDC’s YRBS uses an independent three-stage cluster sample design to achieve a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9–12 who attend public or private schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia (4). The overall response rates for 2017 and 2019 were 60% (14,765) and 60.3% (13,677), respectively. After the removal of responses missing age (153; 0.5%), those indicating legal age to purchase a firearm (i.e., age ≥18 years) (3,412; 12%), and those missing sex (138; 0.5%) or gun carrying information (2,927; 10.3%), the final analytic sample included 21,812 students. Information on YRBS weighting, sampling, and psychometric properties has previously been reported (4,5). YRBS was reviewed and approved by CDC and ICF institutional review boards.† 

The YRBS gun carrying question was modified in 2017 to exclude carrying for recreational use and to expand the time frame from 30 days to 12 months to permit inclusion of infrequent carrying. Gun carrying was assessed by the question, “During the past 12 months, on how many days did you carry a gun? (Do not count the days when you carried a gun only for hunting or for a sport, such as target shooting).” The question reflects overall gun carrying and is not specific to a particular context such as a school or neighborhood. Gun carrying on school property is not assessed in the national YRBS. Both years of data (2017 and 2019) with the same new wording were used to maximize the sample size for analyses with relatively rare experiences and risk behaviors. The prevalence of gun carrying was comparable across years. Responses were coded as zero days versus ≥1 days (1 to ≥6 days), and prevalence differences were examined by sex, race and ethnicity, age, and sexual identity (i.e., heterosexual, gay/lesbian/bisexual, or not sure). Chi-square and t-tests were used to assess demographic differences, with p-values <0.05 considered statistically significant. Associations between gun carrying and 17 independent variables reflecting experiences with violence, suicidal ideation or attempts, or substance use (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/119459) were assessed in separate sex-stratified adjusted logistic regression models, which generated aPRs and corresponding 95% CIs for each independent variable. All regression models included age, race and ethnicity, and sexual identity. SUDAAN statistical software (version 11.0.1; RTI International) accounted for the complex sample design and weighting of the survey. Frequency of gun carrying was examined among 766 male and 209 female students who carried a gun on ≥1 day in the 12 months preceding the survey. Similar models were used to test differences between those who carried a gun on ≥6 days compared with those who carried a gun on 1–5 days. 

Gun carrying was significantly more prevalent among males (6.8%) than among females (1.9%) (Table 1). Among males, gun carrying was most common among non-Hispanic Black (Black) students (10.6%), followed by Hispanic (7.2%) and non-Hispanic White (White) (6.1%) students. Among females, gun carrying was more common among Hispanic (3.5%) than among Black (2.0%) and White students (1.1%). 

Gun carrying was significantly more prevalent among those students who had experienced violence, suicidal ideation or attempts, or substance use than it was among those who had not (Table 2). For example, gun carrying among males and females was more prevalent among those who had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (25.9% and 11.2%, respectively) than it was among those who had not (5.2% and 1.3%, respectively). The aPRs for all 10 violence-related experiences, including fighting, bullying, dating violence, missing school because of safety concerns, and sexual violence, were significant (aPR ranges = 1.6–6.3 and 1.5–10.1 among males and females, respectively). Gun carrying was significantly more prevalent among students who reported seriously considering attempting suicide (aPR for males = 1.9; aPR for females = 1.8) or attempting suicide (aPR for males = 3.1; aPR for females = 3.5) than it was among those who had not. Each substance use measure was associated with higher prevalence of gun carrying (aPR ranges = 4.2–5.2 and 4.3–5.6 among males and females, respectively). Students who had been offered or sold drugs on school property were also more likely to carry a gun (aPR for males = 2.8; aPR for females = 4.0). 

Most students who carried a gun reported carrying on 1–3 days (males = 46.8%; females = 69.8%) or ≥6 days (males = 42.0%; females = 21.6%) during the past 12 months (Figure). Overall, those who carried a gun on ≥6 days were more likely to report three of the violence-related experiences, suicidal ideation or attempts, and all four substance use measures than were those who carried a gun less often (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/119473). 

","The revised YRBS question helps distinguish potentially risky forms of gun carrying from recreational use, and the expanded time frame allows infrequent gun carrying by youths to be included. Whereas one in 15 males and one in 50 females carried a gun at least once in the 12 months before the survey, the prevalence of gun carrying was much higher among some subgroups of youths, particularly those who missed school because of safety concerns and those who had experienced violence. For example, among those who were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property, more than one in four males and one in nine females carried a gun. Youths who carried a gun more frequently were more likely to have engaged in substance use and to have experienced violence. Youths who carry guns often report self-protection as the reason; however, youth gun carrying is associated with risk for serious injury or death (2,6). The higher prevalence of gun carrying among those who have experienced suicidal ideation or attempts or other forms of violence highlights the potential for lethal consequences if firearms are used against oneself or others. The association between youth gun carrying and substance use further suggests an increased risk for impaired, impulsive, situational, or escalating actions (7). 

When variations in gun carrying across racial and ethnic groups and in relation to youth behaviors and experiences are reviewed, consideration of the larger context is important. Social and structural conditions (e.g., concentrated poverty, high crime rates, and economic or residential instability) are associated with youth violence and contribute to inequities in violence among racial and ethnic minority populations (3). Further, youths who have experienced violence, discrimination, or racism might feel an increased need for protection, might be unwilling or unable to rely on law enforcement, and might carry a gun for self-protection (2,6). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, YRBS data are cross-sectional and cannot be used to determine the temporal order of associations. Second, all examined behaviors, including gun carrying, were self-reported and therefore might be misreported. Third, the category of students unsure of their sexual identity might include students who are not yet certain of their sexual identity and students who did not understand the question (4). Finally, YRBS does not collect contextual factors that might elucidate the gun carrying behaviors of youth (e.g., how acquired, where carried, substance use while carrying, and carrying a gun for someone else). 

These findings suggest that a substantial proportion of high school students, particularly those who have experienced violence, suicidal ideation or attempts, or who engage in substance use, carry guns outside the context of hunting or sport. Some studies have found that counseling and education with provision of safety devices can promote safer firearm storage behaviors in the home and that child access prevention laws are associated with reductions in risk for firearm suicide, unintentional firearm injuries, and gun carrying among children and youths (8–10). However, additional research is necessary to identify strategies to prevent youth gun carrying and support effective implementation of such strategies, especially among those youths at highest risk for experiencing violence. Taken together, the results underscore the importance of comprehensive approaches to preventing multiple forms of violence affecting youths and associated behaviors such as substance use and gun carrying. To help states and communities take advantage of the best available evidence to prevent violence, CDC has released a series of technical packages that describe the evidence for programs, policies, and practices to reduce multiple forms of violence, including youth violence, sexual or dating violence, and suicide, through strategies such as connecting youths to caring adults and activities, strengthening economic supports, improving access and delivery of care, creating protective environments, and teaching coping and problem-solving skills (3).","Corresponding author: Thomas R.

Children and adolescents might be at risk for certain post-COVID symptoms and conditions. 

What is added by this report? 

Compared with patients aged 0–17 years without previous COVID-19, those with previous COVID-19 had higher rates of acute pulmonary embolism (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99), venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32), and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this study population. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligible persons aged ≥6 months, are critical to preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent illness, and reducing the public health impact of post-COVID symptoms and conditions among persons aged 0–17 years.

Post–COVID-19 (post-COVID) symptoms and conditions* are new, recurring, or ongoing health problems that occur 4 or more weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). Previous studies have characterized and estimated the incidence of post-COVID conditions among adults (1,2), but data among children and adolescents are limited (3–8). Using a large medical claims database, CDC assessed nine potential post-COVID signs and symptoms (symptoms) and 15 potential post-COVID conditions among 781,419 U.S. children and adolescents aged 0–17 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (patients with COVID-19) compared with 2,344,257 U.S. children and adolescents without recognized COVID-19 (patients without COVID-19) during March 1, 2020–January 31, 2022. The analysis identified several symptoms and conditions with elevated adjusted hazard ratios among patients with COVID-19 (compared with those without). The highest hazard ratios were recorded for acute pulmonary embolism (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99), venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32), and type 1 diabetes (1.23), all of which were rare or uncommon in this study population. Conversely, symptoms and conditions that were most common in this study population had lower aHRs (near or below 1.0). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely than were patients without to experience respiratory signs and symptoms, symptoms of mental conditions, muscle disorders, neurological conditions, anxiety and fear-related disorders, mood disorders, and sleeping disorders. COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligible children and adolescents, are critical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent illness, including post-COVID symptoms and conditions (9). 

CDC analyzed linked medical claims and commercial laboratory data for persons with a health care encounter possibly related to COVID-19.† Analyses were restricted to children and adolescents aged 0–17 years who were continuously enrolled in a health insurance plan during March 1, 2019–January 31, 2022. Children and adolescents aged 0–17 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and those without recognized COVID-19§ were matched 1:3 based on age at encounter, sex, and month of index date.¶ Patients were followed for a minimum of 60 days and a maximum of 365 days or until January 31, 2022, whichever occurred first. Scientific literature on symptoms and conditions associated with post-COVID illness among children or adults was reviewed (1–5). Symptoms and conditions were identified by the first occurrence and classified based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes documented 31–365 days after the index date but not during the 7–365 days preceding the index date.** 

The incidences (occurrence per 100,000 person-years) of nine potential post-COVID symptoms and 15 potential post-COVID conditions among children and adolescents aged 0–17 years were calculated. Separate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate aHRs for each symptom and condition, after excluding persons with that particular symptom or condition during the 7–365 days preceding the index date.†† All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, U.S. Census Bureau region, payor type, previous medical complexity (10), and previous hospitalization.§§ The same models were estimated separately for three age groups (2–4, 5–11, and 12–17 years).¶¶ A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the incidences of potential post-COVID symptoms and conditions among children and adolescents aged 0–17 years who had not experienced any of the 24 assessed symptoms or conditions before the index date.*** Finally, incidence of each symptom and condition among patients with COVID-19 was plotted against aHRs from the main analysis. Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.0; R Foundation); p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††† 

During March 1, 2020–January 31, 2022, a total of 781,419 patients aged 0–17 years with COVID-19 and 2,344,257 patients aged 0–17 years without COVID-19 were identified (Table 1). The median age of both patients with and without COVID-19 was 12 years, and 50.0% in both groups were female; 72.2% of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in Medicaid managed care, compared with 70.6% of patients without COVID-19. Patients without COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of previous hospitalization (4.5%) and complex chronic disease (15.6%), than did patients with COVID-19 (3.6% and 11.7%, respectively). 

Patients with COVID-19 were significantly more likely than were those without to develop the following assessed post-COVID symptoms: smell and taste disturbances (aHR = 1.17), circulatory signs and symptoms (1.07), malaise and fatigue (1.05), and musculoskeletal pain (1.02) (Table 2). Patients with COVID-19 were also more likely than were those without to develop the following assessed post-COVID conditions: acute pulmonary embolism (2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.99), venous thromboembolic event (1.87), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.32), type 1 diabetes (1.23), coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders (1.18), type 2 diabetes (1.17), and cardiac dysrhythmias (1.16). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely than were those without to experience respiratory signs and symptoms (0.91), symptoms of mental conditions (0.91), sleeping disorders (0.91), neurological conditions (0.94), anxiety and fear-related disorders (0.85), mood disorders (0.78), and muscle disorders (0.94); no significant associations were found for the remaining five symptoms and conditions. 

In age-stratified analysis of three age groups (2–4, 5–11, and 12–17 years), the unadjusted incidences of symptoms and conditions differed by age group (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118760). Among children aged 2–4 years, the highest aHRs for patients with COVID-19 compared with patients without COVID-19 were for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (aHR = 2.39), acute and unspecified renal failure (1.52), and coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders (1.47) (Table 3). Unlike other age groups, children aged 2–4 years had higher rates of asthma diagnosis (1.12) and respiratory signs and symptoms (1.07) after COVID-19. Among children aged 5–11 years, the highest aHRs for patients with COVID-19 compared with those without were for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (2.84), venous thromboembolic event (2.69), and acute and unspecified renal failure (1.38). Among patients aged 12–17 years, the highest aHRs for those with COVID-19 compared with those without were for acute pulmonary embolism (2.03), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (1.66), and venous thromboembolic event (1.52). 

The sensitivity analysis of 396,336 patients with COVID-19 and 792,672 matched patients without COVID-19 (without previous symptoms or conditions of interest) found that patients in both groups were healthier at baseline than their counterparts in the main cohort; 84.2% of persons with COVID-19 and 84.8% patients without COVID-19 had no previous documentation of chronic disease, compared with 64.8% and 56.7%, respectively in the main cohort (Table 1). Higher rates of five symptoms and six conditions among patients with COVID-19 compared with those without were found in the sensitivity analysis, whereas the main analysis found higher rates of four symptoms and eight conditions. In the sensitivity analysis, aHRs for type 1 diabetes and venous thromboembolic event were not statistically significant, and the aHR for respiratory signs and symptoms was elevated (1.16) (Table 2). 

Analysis of the relationship between incidence rates among patients with COVID-19 and aHRs found that five post-COVID conditions with the highest aHRs had low incidence rates, ranging from 23 (acute pulmonary embolism) to 140 (type 1 diabetes) per 100,000 person-years (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118761). Conversely, this analysis found that five symptoms and conditions with the highest incidence rates among patients with COVID-19 had lower aHRs (near or below 1.0): respiratory signs and symptoms (0.91), musculoskeletal pain (1.02), anxiety and fear-related disorders (0.85), gastrointestinal and esophageal disorders (1.01), and asthma (1.00).","This analysis found increased incidence rates of several symptoms and conditions during the 31–365 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19 among children and adolescents aged 0–17 years. The highest aHRs were associated with potentially serious conditions, such as acute pulmonary embolism, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, venous thromboembolic event, acute and unspecified renal failure, and type 1 diabetes. These conditions with the highest aHRs were rare or uncommon among children and adolescents in this analysis. Some of the study’s findings are consistent with previous evidence of elevated risk for new onset of diabetes (5), myocarditis (6), and certain symptoms (4), whereas other conditions (acute pulmonary embolism, venous thromboembolic event, acute renal failure, coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders, and cardiac dysrhythmias) have not been previously reported as post-COVID conditions among children and adolescents. 

Several symptoms and conditions (respiratory signs and symptoms, mental health symptoms and conditions, neurological conditions, muscle disorders, and sleeping disorders) were less likely to occur among patients with COVID-19 than among patients without COVID-19. Reasons for these observed associations are likely multifactorial, and might be, in part, because patients without COVID-19 were selected from a cohort of patients with a health care encounter possibly related to COVID-19 and were less healthy than were patients with COVID-19 at baseline. Although most of the symptoms and conditions selected for the analysis were based on those observed in previous post-COVID studies, they are not unique to patients with a history of COVID-19, and many are common among children and adolescents. A United Kingdom study found a high prevalence of poor mental health and wellbeing among all children and adolescents aged 11–17 years during the pandemic, but no difference among those with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (7). Respiratory signs and symptoms were less likely to occur among patients with COVID-19 than among those without in the main cohort. The opposite result was found in a subset of children aged 2–4 years and in a cohort of children and adolescents with no previous symptoms or conditions of interest; new respiratory signs and symptoms were more likely to occur among children and adolescents who had COVID-19, compared with those without a history of COVID-19. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least seven limitations. First, the definitions of potential post-COVID symptoms and conditions are subject to misclassification bias because the symptoms and conditions were defined by a single ICD-10-CM code and no information on laboratory assessments or degree of severity was available. Second, because the incidence date of a symptom or a condition was based on the first occurrence of the ICD-10-CM code, the actual incidence date of that symptom or condition might have occurred prior to COVID-19. Third, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 without a documented COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test result might have been misclassified as not having had COVID-19, potentially reducing the magnitude of observed associations. Fourth, the aHR estimates might be reduced because patients without COVID-19 were patients with a health care encounter possibly related to COVID-19. Fifth, because patients’ vaccination status was likely underreported in this dataset, this analysis was not adjusted for previous receipt of COVID-19 vaccines. Sixth, although this study relied on statistical significance for interpreting the increased rates of symptoms and conditions, further understanding of the clinical significance of the observed associations, including whether these symptoms and conditions are transient or chronic, is necessary. Finally, generalizability might be limited because the analysis was restricted to children and adolescents aged 0–17 years included in a medical claims database, approximately 70% of whom were enrolled in Medicaid managed care; therefore, findings are not necessarily representative of all children and adolescents with COVID-19 or of those who do not seek health care. 

These findings can be used to apprise health care professionals and caregivers about new symptoms and conditions that occur among children and adolescents in the months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligible persons aged ≥6 months, are critical for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent illness and for reducing the public health impact of post-COVID symptoms and conditions.","Corresponding author: Lyudmyla Kompaniyets, opt4@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Kompaniyets L, Bull-Otterson L, Boehmer TK, et al.

Although intracranial bacterial infections occur as a rare complication of partially treated or untreated bacterial rhinosinusitis in adolescents as well as mastoiditis in children of all ages (3), a 236% increase in cases among children was observed at a Michigan children’s hospital (Aldrich A and Ogrin S, Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital of Spectrum Health, unpublished data, 2022). Most of these cases were in infants and children aged <12 years and associated with a diversity of identified pathogens, including a range of Streptococcus species with more severe disease requiring extended intensive care unit admission and multiple surgical interventions; many of the cases had recent or concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. To ascertain whether a similar trend occurred nationally during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey was conducted through the Emergency Infections Network (EIN) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, a provider-based network of approximately 2,800 infectious diseases specialists primarily based in North America. The initial survey was sent to all EIN participants in February 2022 and queried respondents about whether they had observed an increase in intracranial infections or an increase in invasive Streptococcus spp. infections in patients aged ≤18 years during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, irrespective of a recent or concurrent COVID-19 infection. The initial survey included 109 respondents, 47 (43%) of whom reported observing an increase in intracranial infections. A follow-up survey was conducted among 64 EIN respondents who expressed interest in further participation, eight of whom were able to query their electronic medical records to determine case rates before the pandemic (January 1, 2018–January 1, 2020) and during the early pandemic (March 1, 2020–March 1, 2022) using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes (Supplementary Box, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/119620). Data were provided by eight institutions, representing all four U.S. Census Bureau regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). Descriptive statistics, including number of diagnoses by infection type, were used (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/119803). Percent change was calculated for each infection category for each institution, and mean percent change was calculated across institutions. Percent change was used rather than raw numbers because of the wide variability in numbers of cases among institutions. Statistical significance could not be calculated because of the low number of survey respondents. No demographic or COVID-19 vaccination data were collected on individual patients. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted with applicable federal law and CDC policy.* 

During the early COVID-19 pandemic, isolated intracranial abscess increased in the participating institutions by a mean of 100.9% (SD = 133%), and sinusitis complicated by intracranial abscess increased by a mean of 76.7% (SD = 97%). Orbital cellulitis, sinusitis, and mastoiditis all decreased on average by 14.5% (SD = 31%), 31.9% (SD = 17%), and 24.7% (SD = 31%), respectively (Figure). Mastoiditis complicated by intracranial abscess decreased by 116.7% (SD = 96%). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. Because participation in the EIN surveys was voluntary, the results are not representative of intracranial infections throughout the United States. Second, the response rate was low, and response bias possibly affected the findings. Finally, only limited data were collected, and the cross-sectional nature of this analysis precludes inference of causation. 

On June 8, 2022, CDC asked health care providers and health departments to report the occurrence of brain abscess, epidural empyema, or subdural empyema in persons aged ≤18 years without a previous history of neurosurgical procedures or head trauma, hospitalized on or after June 1, 2021, and to retain associated clinical specimens and isolates. To report possible cases,† health care providers should contact their health department and email CDC (CDCStrepInquiry@cdc.gov). 

This initial investigation suggests a possible increase in some forms of intracranial infections in persons aged ≤18 years living in the United States during March 2020–March 2022, coinciding with the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further characterization of affected patients, disease course, temporal association with COVID-19 infection (as well as predominant variants circulating at the time of diagnosis), microbiology of cases, and morbidity and mortality associated with this observation are needed, because the factors causing this possible increase in intracranial infections are not fully understood at this time. Intracranial infections require prompt and intensive medical management; therefore, defining the pathogenesis, relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and other risk factors, can both raise public awareness and help medical providers diagnose and appropriately manage affected patients.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Rosemary M.

Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), a leading cause of liver cancer, is targeted for global elimination.

What is added by this report?

During 2016–2020, global coverage with the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine remained between 82% and 85%, whereas timely coverage with hepatitis B birth dose increased from 37% to 43%. Coverage in 2020 was ≥90% for both the hepatitis B birth dose and the 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine in 41% of countries. In 11 countries, prevalence of HBV surface antigen among children was ≤0.1%.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Accelerating hepatitis B birth dose introduction, increasing coverage with the third dose of hepatitis B vaccine, and monitoring programmatic and impact indicators are essential for elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HBV.

Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) often results in chronic HBV infection, the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer (1). If not vaccinated, nine in 10 children infected at birth will become chronically infected. Globally, an estimated 6.4 million (range = 4.4–10.8 million) children aged ≤5 years are living with chronic HBV infection (2). In 2016, the World Health Assembly endorsed the goal to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, including the elimination of MTCT of HBV (3). Elimination of MTCT of HBV can be validated by demonstrating ≤0.1% prevalence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) among children aged ≤5 years, as well as ≥90% coverage with hepatitis B birth dose (HepB-BD) and 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB3) (4,5). This report describes global progress toward elimination of MTCT of HBV during 2016–2021. By December 2020, 190 (98%) of 194 World Health Organization (WHO) member states* had introduced universal infant vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), and 110 (57%) countries provided HepB-BD to all newborns. During 2016–2020, global HepB3 coverage remained between 82% and 85%, whereas HepB-BD coverage increased from 37% to 43%. In 2020, among the 99 countries reporting both HepB3 and HepB-BD coverage, 41 (41%) achieved ≥90% coverage with both. By December 2021, serosurveys documented ≤0.1% HBsAg prevalence among children in 11 countries. Accelerating HepB-BD introduction, increasing HepB3 coverage, and monitoring programmatic and impact indicators are essential for elimination of MTCT of HBV.

Immunization Activities
Because immunization is a key intervention to prevent MTCT of HBV, WHO recommends that all newborns receive a timely HepB-BD† dose followed by 2–3 additional HepB doses, according to national schedules (1). Countries report immunization data to WHO annually through the WHO and UNICEF Joint Reporting Form. WHO and UNICEF review reported coverage data and surveys to generate country-specific coverage estimates.§ This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶

By 2020, 190 (98%) of 194 countries had introduced universal infant hepatitis B vaccination compared with 186 (96%) in 2016. In 2020, 110 (57%) countries provided HepB-BD** to all newborns, a 10% increase from 100 (52%) in 2016. During 2016–2020, 33 to 34 (17%–18%) countries, mostly in the European Region, administered HepB-BD selectively to newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers (i.e., selective or targeted birth dose vaccination) each year.†† The number of countries that had not introduced routine HepB-BD vaccination declined by 15%, from 60 (31%) in 2016 to 51 (26%) in 2020§§ (Table 1). Most of these countries are in the African Region where 34 (72%) of 47 countries do not provide a HepB-BD.

During 2016–2020, global coverage with HepB3 remained between 82% and 85%, whereas timely coverage with HepB-BD increased from 37% to 43%. During this period, regional HepB3 and HepB-BD coverages were highest in the Western Pacific Region and lowest in the African Region (Table 1). During 2016–2019, HepB3 coverage was ≥90% in 61%–63% of reporting countries; this proportion declined to 52% in 2020. HepB-BD coverage was ≥90% in 51%–58% of reporting countries, with the highest proportion (58%) observed in 2016 and lowest (51%) in 2017. During 2016–2019, among countries that reported coverage with HepB3 and HepB-BD, 47%–54% reported ≥90% coverage for both; this proportion declined to 41% in 2020 (Table 1).

Other Interventions to Prevent Mother-to-Child Transmission
To prevent MTCT of HBV, countries with selective HepB-BD vaccination policies rely on antenatal screening combined with antiviral treatment for eligible HBsAg-positive pregnant women and postexposure prophylaxis for HBV-exposed infants¶¶ (1). Information on the performance of these interventions is usually not reportable and is collected through special studies.

In 2020, among 33 countries with selective HepB-BD vaccination policies, 32 (97%) implemented nationwide antenatal hepatitis B screening, with ≥90% coverage in 17 (89%) of 19 countries with available information. HepB-BD coverage among infants born to HBV-infected mothers was ≥90% in all nine countries with available information (6–8).


HBsAg Seroprevalence in Children and Mother-to-Child Transmission Rate
For countries with a universal HepB-BD vaccination policy, the impact target to achieve elimination of MTCT of HBV is ≤0.1% HBsAg prevalence among children aged ≤5 years; for countries with a selective HepB-BD policy, the impact target also includes an MTCT rate ≤2% (Table 2) (4,5). In 2019, WHO estimated global HBsAg prevalence among children aged ≤5 years to be 0.9%, with prevalence ranging from 0.1% in the Region of the Americas to 2.5% in the African region (Table 3) (2). According to a modeling study, HBsAg prevalence among children aged 5 years in 2016 was ≤0.1% in 52 of 119 countries assessed (9); by December 2021, 11 countries*** had demonstrated HBsAg prevalence ≤0.1% in representative serosurveys. Studies in two countries††† with selective HepB-BD demonstrated an MTCT rate ≤2% (Table 3).


Validation
The Global Validation Advisory Committee for elimination of MTCT of HIV and syphilis was established in 2015. In 2021, the Committee’s role was expanded to include validation of elimination of MTCT of HBV. WHO revised the global guidance on the validation of elimination of MTCT to include “triple” elimination of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B (5). The programmatic and impact indicators for validation of elimination of MTCT of HBV vary according to countries’ HepB vaccination programs (Table 2).

Piloting of validation instruments in seven countries§§§ demonstrated feasibility of their use. Representative serosurvey data to support direct impact measurement were available in five countries.¶¶¶ In England (the pilot did not include the rest of the United Kingdom), HBsAg prevalence and the MTCT rate were extrapolated from routinely collected antenatal screening data. National HepB immunization coverage data were available in all seven pilot countries; subnational data were available in five.****","Substantial progress has been made toward elimination of MTCT of HBV in most WHO regions. Globally, 41 countries reported ≥90% coverage with both HepB-BD and HepB3, a critical component of elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health problem by 2030. Successful implementation of HepB vaccination and other interventions to prevent MTCT globally resulted in a substantial decrease in HBV prevalence among children in all regions except for the African region (2). 

Currently, nearly all countries include HepB in their routine infant immunization schedules; however, during 2016–2020, little change in global coverage for HepB3 and HepB-BD was observed. The introduction of HepB-BD into routine immunization programs in 10 additional countries during 2016–2020 is encouraging. However, the slow increase in the number of countries that include HepB-BD in their routine immunization programs suggests that this process has stalled, especially in the African Region. Further, service disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the decline of the immunization coverage with HepB in 2020, particularly for HepB3 (10). To meet programmatic targets for elimination of MTCT of HBV, interventions to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on immunization systems need to be implemented (10). 

Accelerating the introduction of HepB-BD into the routine immunization programs of remaining countries is essential for achieving global elimination of MTCT of HBV. The African region, which has a high prevalence of chronic HBV infection (2) and where HepB-BD introduction is lagging, requires special attention. Increasing demand among pregnant women and awareness among policymakers and health care workers, improving links between maternal and child health and immunization programs, and ensuring sustainable support would help with successful implementation of HepB-BD vaccination. 

Data on impact measures to support validation of elimination of MTCT of HBV are currently available for only a few countries. Countries that have met immunization coverage targets are encouraged to conduct serosurveys to document HBsAg prevalence. Implementing nationwide hepatitis B serosurveys is challenging, given a large sample size and considerable resource requirements. Integration with other serosurveys†††† or use of multiphase methodology surveys§§§§ could help reduce implementation costs. Although mathematical modeling is not a substitute for serosurveys, triangulation of various data sources could be considered in assessing the elimination of MTCT of HBV. 

To better assess progress toward meeting the elimination targets, countries with selective HepB-BD will need to establish data systems to document performance measures of additional interventions to prevent MTCT of HBV¶¶¶¶ (4,5). Most HBsAg-positive mothers in countries with historically low HBV prevalence come from countries where prevalence is high (6); therefore, ensuring equal access for foreign-born women to antenatal services and MTCT prevention interventions is important. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, missing immunization data from some countries that did not report to WHO prevent accurate assessment of global and regional coverage. Second, in countries with selective HepB-BD vaccination, limited data availability hampers evaluation of their progress toward elimination of MTCT. 

Elimination of MTCT of HBV is achievable with the currently available tools; based on modeled estimates, Elimination of MTCT might have already been attained in several countries (9). Countries will be able to apply for validation once the standardized tools are finalized. For countries with a high prevalence of HBV that do not yet have the capability to achieve impact targets, milestones known as the Path to Elimination which assess progress toward achieving programmatic targets (5) are available to measure progress toward elimination of MTCT. Integration of activities to prevent MTCT of HBV with interventions to prevent MTCT of HIV and syphilis provides the opportunity to synergize across these programs to help achieve triple elimination. Once achieved globally, elimination of MTCT of HBV will result in removing perinatal transmission as a source of chronic HBV infections and will be an important milestone toward achieving elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat.","Corresponding author: Nino Khetsuriani, nkhetsuriani@cdc.gov, 404-718-2710.","Suggested citation for this article: Khetsuriani N, Lesi O, Desai S, Armstrong PA, Tohme RA.

On July 13, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration issued Emergency Use Authorization for the NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) COVID-19 vaccine. 

What is added by this report? 

On July 19, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made an interim recommendation for use of the Novavax vaccine in persons aged ≥18 years as a primary 2-dose series vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

The adjuvanted, protein subunit–based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine provides an additional option for unvaccinated adults, increasing flexibility for the public and for vaccine providers. Vaccination is important for protection against COVID-19.

The NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax) COVID-19 vaccine is a recombinant spike (rS) protein nanoparticle vaccine with Matrix-M adjuvant to protect against infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. On July 13, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Novavax vaccine for primary COVID-19 immunization of unvaccinated adults aged ≥18 years, administered as 2 doses (5 μg rS and 50 μg Matrix-M adjuvant in each dose) 3 weeks apart (1). On July 19, 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued an interim recommendation for use of the Novavax vaccine in persons aged ≥18 years for the prevention of COVID-19.* In the per-protocol† efficacy analysis, vaccine efficacy (VE) against reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 was 89.6% (95% CI = 82.4%–93.8%). The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 was the predominant circulating variant during the period of case accrual for VE assessments. Cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in temporal association with vaccination, suggesting a possible causal relationship. The ACIP recommendation for the use of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is interim and will be updated as additional information becomes available. The adjuvanted, protein subunit-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine provides an additional option for unvaccinated adults, increasing flexibility for the public and for vaccine providers. Vaccination is important for protection against COVID-19. 

Since June 2020, ACIP has convened 31 public meetings to review data relevant to the epidemiology of COVID-19 and considerations for the use of COVID-19 vaccines, including the Novavax vaccine.§ The ACIP COVID-19 Vaccines Work Group (Work Group), comprising experts in adult and pediatric medicine, infectious diseases, vaccinology, vaccine safety, public health, and ethics, has held weekly meetings to review COVID-19 surveillance data, evidence for VE, postauthorization effectiveness, safety, and implementation considerations for COVID-19 vaccines. To guide its deliberations regarding recommendations for use of these vaccines, ACIP used the Evidence to Recommendation (EtR) Framework¶ and incorporated a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach** (2). Within the EtR Framework, ACIP considered the importance of COVID-19 as a public health problem, as well as population values and preferences, acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity regarding use of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged ≥18 years. After conducting systematic reviews of published and unpublished evidence for benefits and harms, the Work Group used the GRADE approach to independently assess the certainty of evidence for outcomes related to the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, rated on a scale of type 1 (high certainty) to type 4 (very low certainty)†† (2). Work Group conclusions regarding evidence for use of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged ≥18 years were presented to ACIP at a public meeting on July 19, 2022. 


Summary of Evidence for Use of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine in Persons Aged ≥18 Years 
The body of evidence regarding efficacy of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged ≥18 years consisted of data from one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial (2019nCoV-301), based in the United States and Mexico, in which 29,945 participants aged ≥18 years were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to receive 2 intramuscular doses of either Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (5 μg rS and 50 μg Matrix-M adjuvant) or saline placebo, separated by an interval of 3 weeks (3). Upon completion of the assigned study arm (i.e., receipt of either 2 doses of vaccine or 2 doses of placebo), trial participants were offered the opportunity to cross over in a blinded fashion (“blinded crossover”) from their originally assigned study arm. Therefore, all trial participants had the opportunity to receive trial vaccine in either the precrossover or postcrossover period, while remaining blinded throughout. Efficacy and safety data are available from the precrossover period (December 27, 2020–September 27, 2021) of this trial, and these data comprise the basis of the assessment made using the GRADE approach. Data from additional sources were considered in assessment of benefits and harms, as guided by the EtR Framework. These sources included additional safety data available from the postcrossover period of 2019nCoV-301, safety data from three additional Novavax clinical trials based in the United Kingdom (2019nCoV-302), South Africa (2019nCoV-501), and Australia (2019nCoV-101), postmarketing safety data submitted to FDA by Novavax summarizing administration of 744,235 doses of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine globally as of April 30, 2022 (4), and publicly available data pertaining to the administration of 160,000 Novavax COVID-19 vaccine doses in Australia as of June 26, 2022 (5). 

The primary efficacy endpoint was diagnosis of RT-PCR–confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 ≥7 days after receipt of the second dose in the 2-dose primary series of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine arm compared with that in the placebo arm. Per the manufacturer’s trial protocol, COVID-19 cases were only included in the efficacy analysis if they were RT-PCR–confirmed by a designated central laboratory. The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed until a participant received the first blinded crossover vaccination or until the data cutoff date of September 27, 2021, whichever occurred earlier. The per-protocol VE analysis population included 17,272 Novavax COVID-19 vaccine recipients and 8,385 placebo recipients with a median 2.5 months of blinded follow-up after receipt of dose 2. VE§§ against RT-PCR–confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, observed during the period of Alpha variant predominance, was 89.6% (95% CI = 82.4%–93.8%) in persons aged ≥18 years without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.¶¶ This estimate was based on symptomatic illness in 17 vaccine recipients and 79 placebo recipients, none of whom was hospitalized. VE against severe COVID-19*** was 100%, based on four severe cases in the placebo group and none in the vaccine group. Subgroup analyses by age demonstrated VE against RT-PCR–confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 of 90.3% (95% CI = 83.1%–94.4%) among participants aged 18–64 years and 76.3% (95% CI = 29.1%–95.7%) among participants aged ≥65 years. A post hoc analysis of VE††† among participants aged 50–64 years demonstrated VE of 90.7% (95% CI = 72.9%–96.8%) against RT-PCR–confirmed symptomatic COVID-19. Additional evidence pertaining to potential VE in persons aged ≥65 years was provided through immunobridging. The measure of immune response to 2 doses of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥65 years without evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was slightly lower than that observed in persons aged 50–64 years, with a geometric mean ratio (GMR) for day 35 neutralizing antibody titer of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.68–1.2) for persons aged ≥65 years, demonstrating estimates that would have met FDA’s usual success criterion for immunobridging noninferiority.§§§ Subgroup analyses of VE against RT-PCR–confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 by ethnicity and race demonstrated that most estimates by ethnicity and race (when calculable from the data) were comparable to the per-protocol VE overall, but VE in participants of Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) ethnicity was lower (75.7%; 95% CI = 46.0%–89.1%). 

Among vaccine recipients aged ≥18 years, reactogenicity, defined as solicited local and systemic reactions during the 7 days after vaccination, was reported frequently. Following dose 2, 78.6% of participants reported any local reactions, and 69.3% reported any systemic reactions. Most solicited reactions were mild to moderate and lasted 1–3 days; all were reported more frequently after dose 2 than after dose 1 among vaccine recipients. Severe solicited reactions (grade 3 or higher, defined as interfering with daily activity) were more common in vaccine (16.3%) than placebo (4.0%) recipients. Severe solicited local reactions occurred in 1.1% of vaccine recipients after dose 1 and in 6.7% after dose 2, compared with 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively, in placebo recipients. Severe solicited systemic reactions occurred in 2.4% of vaccine recipients after dose 1 and in 12.1% after dose 2, compared with 2.1% after each dose among placebo recipients. Reported reactions varied with age and were more common among vaccine recipients aged 18–64 years than among those aged ≥65 years. Among vaccine recipients aged 18–64 years, the most common reactions associated with any vaccine dose included injection site pain or tenderness (82.2%), fatigue (62.0%), muscle pain (54.1%), and headache (52.9%). In participants aged ≥65 years, the most common vaccine-associated reactions associated with any dose included injection site pain or tenderness (63.4%), fatigue (39.2%), muscle pain (30.2%), and headache (29.2%). The most common grade 3 or higher local reaction reported by vaccine recipients after dose 2 was pain or tenderness at the injection site (6.3%). The most common grade 3 or higher systemic reaction reported by vaccine recipients after dose 2 was fatigue (10.5%). Reports of unsolicited serious adverse events¶¶¶ were comparable between vaccine (1.0%) and placebo (1.1%) recipients in the precrossover period and among participants who crossed over to receive Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (1.4%) and placebo (1.2%) in the postcrossover period. 

Cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were detected in Novavax clinical trials. Among a total of 41,546 vaccine recipients aged ≥16 years, including within both precrossover and postcrossover vaccine arms in 2019nCoV-301, as well as all vaccine recipients in 2019nCoV-302, 2019nCoV-501, and 2019-nCoV101 combined, six cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were detected; five occurred within 20 days of vaccination. Among these five, four did not have likely alternative etiologies, suggesting a possible causal relationship with vaccine. Cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have also been detected in global postauthorization surveillance; during a period in which 744,235 doses of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine were administered in Australia, Canada, the European Union, New Zealand, and South Korea, 35 reports (representing 36 adverse events) were identified among 20 male and 15 female vaccine recipients with a median age of 34 years (range = 23–62 years): 29 reports of pericarditis, including five in persons with a history of pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccine; four myocarditis cases; two myopericarditis cases; and one case of carditis, not otherwise specified. A postmarketing analysis from Australia identified three cases of myocarditis and 12 cases of pericarditis reported during a period in which 160,000 Novavax COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered (5). 

In addition to the myocarditis or pericarditis cases detected in Novavax clinical trials, one case of angioedema (2019nCoV-301) and one case of Guillain-Barré syndrome (2019nCoV-302) were also considered to be potentially related to vaccination. A detailed summary of safety data, including information on reactogenicity, is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/novavax/reactogenicity.html. 

From GRADE evidence assessment, the level of certainty for the benefits of Novavax COVID-19 vaccination among persons aged ≥18 years was type 1 (high certainty) for the prevention of symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 assessed using direct efficacy. Evidence was type 3 (low certainty) for prevention of COVID-19–associated hospitalization. No COVID-19–associated hospitalizations were present in the per-protocol trial efficacy analysis; therefore, the outcome was evaluated using severe COVID-19 as a surrogate measure. Concerns of imprecision arose because of the small number of severe COVID-19 events. Regarding potential harms after vaccination, evidence was type 1 (high certainty) for serious adverse events and reactogenicity of grade 3 or higher. No data were available to assess other GRADE benefits, including prevention of death due to COVID-19 or prevention of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. 

Recommendations for Use of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine in Persons Aged ≥18 Years 
Data reviewed within the EtR Framework supported use of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine in persons aged ≥18 years. COVID-19 remains a major public health problem in the United States. As of July 14, 2022, approximately 89 million COVID-19 cases have occurred in the United States, and outcomes have been most severe among adults: of 4,936,004 COVID-19–related hospitalizations in the United States during August 1, 2020–July 10, 2022, most (4,798,764; 97.2%) were among persons aged ≥18 years; and >99% of 1,015,431 COVID-19–related deaths in the United States through July 13, 2022, were among persons aged ≥18 years (6,7). COVID-19 continues to expose longstanding health inequities in the United States, as racial and ethnic minority populations continue to experience a disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 (8). 

The benefits of receiving a primary COVID-19 vaccination series with authorized or approved vaccines are clear (1,3,9). Outcomes of COVID-19 among persons who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 are significantly worse than those among persons who have received at least a primary vaccination series; in April 2022, among persons aged ≥5 years, unvaccinated persons had six times the risk of dying from COVID-19 compared with those who had received a primary COVID-19 vaccination series (9). However, the benefits of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine in the context of currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants is unknown because VE was assessed during the period of Alpha predominance. Direct evidence of efficacy against the Omicron variant or any of its sublineages is not yet available; evaluation of Novavax COVID-19 VE, including the subgroups in which VE in the trial appeared to have been potentially relatively lower (persons aged ≥65 years and persons of Hispanic ethnicity), will be based on postauthorization surveillance. 

In evaluation of potential harms, cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were detected during Novavax COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials; in addition, reports of myocarditis or pericarditis were identified during postauthorization use of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine in countries outside the United States (1). These reports underscore the critical importance of ongoing vaccine safety surveillance in the United States and internationally to help assess the possible risk for Novavax COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis or pericarditis, in addition to ongoing monitoring of myocarditis or pericarditis after receipt of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and continued communication with health care providers. 

As of May 2022, an estimated 13.9% of persons aged ≥18 years in the United States remained unvaccinated against COVID-19 (10). The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine that uses more traditional vaccine technology provides an additional option for unvaccinated persons. Recent data reflect some interest in protein-based adjuvanted vaccines such as the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (2). A survey designed to assess vaccination intentions for adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted protein-based COVID-19 vaccines among unvaccinated Americans conducted during January–February 2022 found that 16.0% of unvaccinated adults said that they “probably” or “definitely” would get an adjuvanted protein-based vaccine, with significantly lower intent among non-Hispanic White persons (9.6%) than among non-Hispanic Black or African American (20.1%) and Hispanic persons (19.5%), and with significantly higher intent among men (21.8%) than among women (11.9%) (2). 

Although uncertainty remains in the valuation of the vaccine by all populations, it was determined that for most populations, the desirable effects of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any potential undesirable effects. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is likely acceptable, and implementation of vaccination feasible, particularly in the context of knowledge gained over the course of >1.5 years of distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. 

Before vaccination, the EUA Fact Sheet should be provided to vaccine recipients and their caregivers. Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is authorized as a 2-dose primary series separated by 3 weeks. Some studies with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (11) have indicated that the small risk of myocarditis or pericarditis might be reduced with a longer interval between doses; however, no data currently exist for Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. Consequently, based on evidence of benefits of an extended interval in persons receiving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, an 8-week interval between Novavax doses may be selected to potentially reduce the risk for myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination. Development of myocarditis or pericarditis after a dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is a precaution to a subsequent dose of any COVID-19 vaccine. Additional clinical guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html. ACIP will continue to review additional data as they become available. 

Reporting of Vaccine Adverse Events 
Adverse events that occur after receipt of any COVID-19 vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Vaccination providers are required by FDA to report vaccine administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death after administration of COVID-19 vaccine under EUA. Reporting is encouraged for any clinically significant adverse event even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event. Information on how to submit a report to VAERS is available at https://vaers.hhs.gov/index.html or 1-800-822-7967. In addition, CDC has established v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based active surveillance system that monitors adverse events occurring after COVID-19 vaccination. Reports to v-safe indicating a medically significant health impact are followed up by CDC’s v-safe call center to collect additional information, and complete a VAERS report, if indicated. Information on v-safe is available at https://www.cdc.gov/vsafe.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Evelyn Twentyman, ydj2@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Twentyman E, Wallace M, Roper LE, et al.

Chronic conditions are common, costly, and major causes of death and disability. Addressing conditions in young adulthood can help slow disease progression and improve well-being across the life span; however, recent estimates among young adults have not been reported. 

What is added by this report? 

In 2019, 53.8% of adults aged 18─34 years had at least one chronic condition, and 22.3% had more than one condition. Prevalence of any as well as specific chronic conditions varied by population subgroup. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Coordinated efforts might help improve the availability of evidence-based interventions, policies, and programs that are effective in preventing, treating, and managing chronic conditions in young adults.

Chronic conditions are common, costly, and major causes of death and disability.* Addressing chronic conditions and their determinants in young adulthood can help slow disease progression and improve well-being across the life course (1); however, recent prevalence estimates examining chronic conditions in young adults overall and by subgroup have not been reported. CDC analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to measure prevalence of 11 chronic conditions among adults aged 18–34 years overall and by selected characteristics, and to measure prevalence of health-related risk behaviors by chronic condition status. In 2019, more than one half (53.8%) of adults aged 18–34 years reported having at least one chronic condition, and nearly one quarter (22.3%) reported having more than one chronic condition. The most prevalent conditions were obesity (25.5%), depression (21.3%), and high blood pressure (10.7%). Differences in the prevalence of having a chronic condition were most noticeable between young adults with a disability (75.8%) and without a disability (48.3%) and those who were unemployed (62.3%) and students (45.8%). Adults aged 18–34 years with a chronic condition were more likely than those without one to report binge drinking, smoking, or physical inactivity. Coordinated efforts by public and private sectors might help raise awareness of chronic conditions among young adults and help improve the availability of evidence-based interventions, policies, and programs that are effective in preventing, treating, and managing chronic conditions among young adults (1). 

BRFSS is an annual state-based, random-digit–dialed telephone survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. adults aged ≥18 years.† In 2019, BRFSS included data from 67,104 respondents aged 18–34 years; New Jersey did not collect sufficient data to meet the minimum requirement for inclusion in the public-use data set. The median response rate for the remaining 49 states and the District of Columbia was 49.4% (range = 37.3% for New York to 73.1% for South Dakota).§ Having a chronic condition was defined as responding “yes” to having ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that the respondent had any of the following: a depressive disorder (depression); arthritis; a heart attack, angina, coronary heart disease, or stroke (heart disease/stroke); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; skin or other types of cancer (cancer); kidney disease; diabetes; high cholesterol; high blood pressure; or current asthma. The five conditions with the lowest prevalence were combined into a single variable called “other.” Obesity (body mass index ≥30.0 kg/m2) was based on self-reported height and weight. Health-related risk behaviors included self-reported binge drinking, current smoking, and physical inactivity.¶ 

Prevalence of any condition and of each specific condition was estimated overall and by selected sociodemographic, location, and health-related characteristics, including self-rated health and access to health care. Prevalence of each health-related risk behavior was estimated by chronic condition status. Paired t-tests were conducted to identify subgroup differences among all pairs except those including other race and ethnicity and other employment status. Although all comparisons reported are statistically significant (Bonferroni-corrected p-value <0.05), only sociodemographic and location comparisons where the prevalence ratio is >1.3 will be discussed. Multiple imputation techniques were used to account for missing data.** SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and SUDAAN (version 11.0; RTI International) were used to account for survey weights and the complex sampling design. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†† 

Overall, 53.8% (39.8 million) of adults aged 18–34 years had at least one of the 11 conditions, and 22.3% had more than one condition (Figure 1). The most frequently reported conditions were obesity (25.5%), depression (21.3%), and high blood pressure (10.7%), and more than one half (ranging from 53.9% among adults with obesity to among 86.0% of adults with diabetes) of those with a specific condition had at least one other condition. For example, although 25.5% of young adults had obesity, 13.7% of young adults had obesity and at least one other condition. Having any chronic condition was significantly associated with all selected characteristics. Differences in the prevalence of having any condition by sociodemographic and location characteristics were most noticeable between young adults with a disability (75.8%) and those without a disability (48.3%) and those who were unemployed (62.3%) and a student (45.8%) (Table). 

Consistent with having any condition, the prevalence of having obesity, depression, or high blood pressure was significantly associated with nearly all selected characteristics. Differences in the prevalence for having obesity were most noticeable between young adults aged 25–34 years (29.8%) and 18–24 years (19.4%), non-Hispanic Black persons (33.7%) and non-Hispanic White persons (23.9%), those who were unemployed (29.2%) or employed (26.1%) and a student (15.9%), those with (32.3%) and without (23.8%) a disability, and those living in rural (32.9%) and urban (25.1%) areas. Differences in the prevalence of having depression were most noticeable between females (27.0%) and males (15.8%), non-Hispanic White persons (27.0%) and non-Hispanic Black persons (16.0%) or Hispanic persons (14.6%), adults who were unemployed (30.9%) and employed (19.4%), and those with (48.9%) and without (14.5%) a disability. Differences in the prevalence of high blood pressure were most noticeable between males (13.4%) and females (7.8%), young adults aged 25–34 years (12.7%) and 18–24 years (7.9%), non-Hispanic Black persons (12.5%) and Hispanic persons (9.4%), those who were unemployed (13.5%) or employed (11.0%) and a student (7.1%), those with (17.3%) and without (9.0%) a disability, and those living in rural (13.7%) and urban (10.5%) areas. Prevalence of health-related risk behaviors was higher among those with any condition than among those without one (Figure 2).","Approximately one half of young adults reported at least one chronic condition, with the most common being obesity (25.5%), depression (21.3%), and high blood pressure (10.7%). Young adults with any chronic condition were more likely than those without a chronic condition to report binge drinking, smoking, and physical inactivity. Because chronic conditions become more prevalent with age, a focus on prevention and risk factors is essential for health across the life span. These findings highlight the importance of increasing the availability of evidence-based strategies tailored to young adults to improve the prevention, treatment, and management of chronic conditions. 

Research among the adult population has found differences in the prevalence of specific chronic conditions by sociodemographic characteristics. For example, the prevalence of obesity was higher among adults aged 25–44 years than among those aged 20–24 years (2). Obesity prevalence was also highest among adults with a physical activity limitation disability (2). The prevalence estimates for obesity and hypertension were also elevated among non-Hispanic Black persons, those unemployed but previously working, and adults not living in a metropolitan statistical area (3). Long-standing inequities§§ across many chronic conditions might be reduced by addressing social determinants of health and removing systemic and long-standing barriers to practicing healthy behaviors (e.g., poor living and working conditions and racial discrimination) (1,4). Moreover, consistent with what is known regarding risk factors for chronic conditions (5), young adults who reported binge drinking, smoking, and physical inactivity were more likely to have at least one chronic condition than those who did not report these behaviors, and some of the common chronic conditions in this age group (obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol) are metabolic risk factors for other chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes or heart disease).¶¶ Addressing health behaviors and intermediate conditions among young adults can help improve long-term health and well-being over the life course (1). 

Including a developmental perspective and incorporating mechanisms and channels that specifically resonate with young adults might help improve the effectiveness of strategies to reduce the prevalence of chronic conditions among this group. However, health interventions and programs to help guide individual-, clinical-, and community-level strategies to improve chronic conditions in this population are limited (1). The National Academies report on Investing in the Health and Well-Being of Young Adults provides a set of recommendations across domains to develop evidence-based practices for young adults for medical and behavioral health, including prevention (1). For example, within the health care domain, the report recommends building on evidence-based practices shown to be effective in adults of all ages and adolescents to 1) identify and determine the efficacy of practices that might be promising in young adults, 2) identify practices that once modified are likely to be effective, and 3) support research to develop practices in young adults in areas identified as unlikely to be addressed with current practices (1). Within the public health infrastructure domain, the report recommends research 1) in the effectiveness of multilevel strategies in improving health outcomes and reaching hard-to-reach young adults, 2) on how social media influences health outcomes, and 3) to improve understanding of how social determinants of health and other factors contribute to health disparities among young adults (1). These recommendations provide a broad framework that can guide the development of effective strategies to improve the health of young adults. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, BRFSS data are self-reported and subject to recall and social-desirability biases. For example, prevalence of self-reported, physician-diagnosed chronic conditions might be underestimated; however, state-level prevalence of some conditions is consistent with estimates derived from electronic health records (6). Second, the median response rate of 49.4% might reduce generalizability; however, BRFSS uses a sophisticated weighting method (iterative proportional fitting) that does not require demographic information for small geographic areas, thereby reducing the potential for certain biases (7). 

Approximately one half of young adults reported at least one chronic condition. Continued efforts are needed to help identify, develop, and modify, where necessary, effective strategies to prevent, treat, and manage chronic conditions in young adults. Public health professionals might consider tailoring individual- and community-level strategies to young adults.","Corresponding author: Kathleen B.

CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on U.S. influenza activity and viruses. 

What is added by this report? 

The severity of the 2021–22 influenza season was low, with two waves of influenza A activity. Influenza activity continued from October 2021 through mid-June 2022, with A(H3N2) viruses predominating throughout the season. This report also describes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2022–23 influenza vaccine. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Because of the atypical timing and duration of influenza activity, providers and patients should consider influenza infection as a cause of respiratory illness. Testing for seasonal influenza and monitoring for novel viruses, especially avian A(H5N1) and swine viruses, should continue year-round. Receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences.

Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, influenza activity in the United States typically began to increase in the fall and peaked in February. During the 2021–22 season, influenza activity began to increase in November and remained elevated until mid-June, featuring two distinct waves, with A(H3N2) viruses predominating for the entire season. This report summarizes influenza activity during October 3, 2021–June 11, 2022, in the United States and describes the composition of the Northern Hemisphere 2022–23 influenza vaccine. Although influenza activity is decreasing and circulation during summer is typically low, remaining vigilant for influenza infections, performing testing for seasonal influenza viruses, and monitoring for novel influenza A virus infections are important. An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) is ongoing; health care providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds should remain vigilant for onset of symptoms consistent with influenza. Receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. 

The United States influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDC and its many partners in state, local, and territorial health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, health care providers, hospitals, clinics, emergency departments, and long-term care facilities. This report is a summary of the 2021–22 influenza season. This report was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.† 

Virus Surveillance 
U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System laboratories, which include both clinical and public health laboratories throughout the United States, contribute to virologic surveillance for influenza. Clinical laboratories tested 2,850,954 respiratory specimens using clinical diagnostic tests for influenza viruses. Among these, 128,302 (4.5%) specimens tested positive, including 126,477 (98.6%) for influenza A and 1,825 (1.4%) for influenza B. The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza each week ranged from 0.1% to 9.9% (Figure 1). Public health laboratories tested 877,928 specimens and reported 24,432 (2.8%) positive specimens, with 24,306 (99.5%) positive for influenza A and 126 (0.5%) positive for influenza B viruses. Among 19,127 seasonal influenza A viruses that were subtyped, 25 (0.1%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 19,102 (99.9%) were influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza B lineage information was available for 41 (32.5%) influenza B viruses; 40 (97.6%) were B/Victoria lineage viruses, and one (2.4%) was a B/Yamagata lineage virus.§ Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant virus throughout the 2021–22 influenza season nationally and among all 10 U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) regions.¶ The percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories had two distinct waves in nine of the 10 HHS regions; region 8 (Mountain) experienced a single wave of influenza activity. These nine regions experienced a first wave that peaked in mid-December 2021. A second wave occurred later with peaks ranging from mid-March to May 2022. Regions 6 and 7 (Central and South Central, respectively) peaked in mid-March; regions 2, 3, and 5 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, mid-Atlantic, and Midwest, respectively) peaked in April 2022; and regions 1, 4, 8, 9, and 10 (New England, Southeast, Mountain, West Coast, and Pacific Northwest, respectively) peaked in May 2022. All 10 regions experienced the highest percentage of positive test results during the later time frame. 

Among the A(H3N2) viruses with age data available, 10%, 51%, 28%, and 11% were reported from persons aged 0–4, 5–24, 25–64, and ≥65 years, respectively. The number of A(H1N1)pdm09, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses reported was too small to analyze by age group. 


Novel Influenza A 
Novel influenza viruses are influenza A virus subtypes that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza H1 and H3 viruses. During the 2021–22 influenza season, four novel influenza A viruses were detected in humans. Three were variant viruses (i.e., a swine influenza virus identified in a person and designated with a “v”); one A(H1N2)v virus was identified in a person in California, one A(H3N2)v in a person in Ohio, and one A(H1)v in a person in Oklahoma. One avian A(H5N1) virus was identified in a person in Colorado who was exposed to birds infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1). The A(H5N1) identification was the first positive test result for avian influenza A(H5) virus in a human in the United States (1). 


Virus Characterization 
Genetic characterization was carried out using next-generation sequencing, and the genomic data were analyzed and submitted to public databases (GenBank: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ or EpiFlu: https://www.gisaid.org/). Antigenic characterizations were conducted using hemagglutination inhibition assays or virus neutralization–based focus reduction assays to evaluate whether genetic changes in circulating viruses affected antigenicity; substantial differences could affect vaccine effectiveness. CDC genetically characterized 1,757 specimens (1,733 influenza A and 24 influenza B) collected in the United States during October 3, 2021–June 11, 2022, and antigenically characterized a subset of genetically characterized specimens (2). All 12 genetically characterized A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belonged to the 6B.1A clade, with nine belonging to the 5a.1 subclade, and three belonging to the 5a.2 subclade. Of the five A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses antigenically characterized, two were well recognized by ferret antisera raised against cell-grown and egg-grown vaccine reference viruses. All 1,721 influenza A(H3N2) viruses genetically characterized belonged to the 3C.2a1b clade with 1,717 (99.7%) belonging to the 2a.2 subclade. Of the 129 A(H3N2) viruses antigenically characterized, five (3.9%) were well recognized by ferret antisera raised against cell-grown vaccine reference viruses, and 22 (17%) well recognized by ferret antisera raised against egg-grown vaccine reference viruses. Among the 24 influenza B/Victoria viruses that were tested, all belonged to the V1A clade, with 15 (62.5%) belonging to the V1A.3a.2 subclade and nine (37.5%) belonging to the V1A.3 subclade. Eleven (73%) of the 15 B/Victoria viruses antigenically characterized were well recognized by ferret antisera raised against cell-grown and egg-grown vaccine reference viruses. 

CDC also analyzes influenza viruses for susceptibility to antivirals. A total of 1,782 viruses were genetically characterized for susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors, and a subset of 314 (19%) were tested phenotypically (2). All genetically characterized viruses were predicted to be susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors, except three A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that had an NA-H275Y amino acid substitution, a marker of oseltamivir resistance. Among the viruses tested phenotypically, only three A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that had an NA-H275Y amino acid substitution did not display normal inhibition by neuraminidase inhibitors. A total of 1,757 viruses were genetically characterized for susceptibility to the polymerase acidic (PA) cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir, and a subset of 535 (33%) were tested phenotypically (2). One A(H3N2) virus had a PA-I38M amino acid substitution, which conferred reduced baloxavir susceptibility, and all remaining tested viruses were susceptible to baloxavir. 


Composition of the 2022–23 Influenza Vaccines 
Vaccine strains for the 2022–23 influenza vaccines were selected by the Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee based on WHO’s recommended Northern Hemisphere 2022–23 influenza vaccine composition. No changes were made to the A(H1N1)pdm09 or the B/Yamagata egg-based, cell-based, or recombinant vaccine recommended components. The recommended A(H3N2) component was changed to an A/Darwin/9/2021 (H3N2)–like virus for egg-based vaccines and an A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)–like virus for cell-based or recombinant vaccines. The B/Victoria component recommendation was changed to a B/Austria/1359417/2021–like virus (3,4). The clade and subclade for the recommended vaccine strains were 6b.1A.5a.2 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 3C.2a1b.2a.2 for A(H3N2), V1A.3a.2 for B/Victoria, and Y3 for B/Yamagata. 

Outpatient Illness Surveillance 
Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI),** recorded in the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network was at or above the national baseline†† (2.5%) for 8 consecutive weeks during December and January and peaked at 4.8% during the week ending January 1, 2022. This peak coincided with the rise in activity of SARS-CoV-2 related to the Omicron variant. ILI activity increased again from mid-February through mid-May, but stayed below baseline. Multiple respiratory viruses were cocirculating during both periods of increasing ILI activity, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varied by week and location. 

Long-Term Care Facilities Surveillance 
Reporting of influenza among residents of long-term care facilities§§ was added to the national influenza surveillance system for the 2021–22 season. The weekly percentage of facilities reporting at least one influenza-positive test result among residents ranged from 0.1% to 1.4%. 

Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations 
CDC has monitored hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza infections through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET),¶¶ which covers approximately 9% of the U.S. population, for many years. During the 2021–22 influenza season, HHS Protect Hospitalization Surveillance,*** which consists of reports from all U.S. hospitals, was added to monitor severe illnesses requiring hospitalization in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. During October 1, 2021–June 11, 2022, a total of 5,079 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites. Activity occurred in two waves, with hospitalization rates first peaking nationally during the week ending January 1, 2022 (week 52) at 0.9 per 100,000 population and the second, slightly higher peak, during the week ending April 30, 2022 (week 17) at 1.2 per 100,000 population (Figure 2). 

The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 17.3 per 100,000 population, with the highest rate among adults aged ≥65 years (50.0), followed by children aged 0–4 years (21.9), adults aged 50–64 years (16.0), children and adolescents aged 5–17 years (9.0), and was lowest among adults aged 18–49 years (9.1). Most (96.7%) influenza-related hospitalizations were associated with influenza A viruses (98.8% of those subtyped were A[H3N2] viruses). Among patients with information about underlying conditions, 93.3% of adults and 64.8% of children and adolescents reported at least one underlying medical condition. 

A total of 62,300 influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported to HHS Protect Hospitalization Surveillance during two waves of activity; the total cumulative rate was 19.0 per 100,000 population. Similar to FluSurv-NET–reported activity, nationwide, the first wave of admissions peaked during late December (week ending January 1, 2022), and the second, higher peak, occurred during mid-April (week ending April 23, 2022). Regionally, the timing of the second wave peak varied; regions 6 and 7 (Central and South Central, respectively) peaked in mid-March, regions 2, 3, and 5 (New York/New Jersey/Puerto Rico, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest, respectively) peaked in April, regions 1, 8, 9, and 10 (New England, Mountain, West Coast, and Pacific Northwest, respectively) peaked in May, and region 4 (Southeast) peaked in early June. 

Influenza Mortality 
According to the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, the weekly percentage of deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 remained above the epidemic threshold††† during the entire 2021–22 season. Among the 387,112 deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 reported during 2021–22, a total of 277,350 (71.6%) death certificates listed COVID-19 as an underlying or contributing cause of death, and 2,493 (0.6%) listed influenza, indicating that pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19–associated mortality during 2021–22 was due primarily to COVID-19 and not influenza. 

CDC monitors pediatric influenza-associated deaths through the Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System. During October 3, 2021–June 11, 2022, a total of 31 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC; all were associated with an influenza A virus infection, and all of the 13 influenza A viruses with subtyping information were A(H3N2) viruses. The mean age was 6 years (range = 2 months–16 years), and 21 (67.7%) children and adolescents died after hospital admission. Among the 29 children and adolescents with a known medical history, 19 (65.5%) had at least one underlying medical condition associated with increased risk for influenza-related complications. 

Preliminary Estimates of Influenza Burden 
CDC uses the cumulative rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations reported through FluSurv-NET and a mathematical model to estimate the number of persons who have symptomatic influenza illness and who had a medical visit or were hospitalized for or died from influenza (5). Using data available during October 1, 2021–June 11, 2022, CDC estimates that influenza virus infection resulted in 8.0–13.0 million symptomatic illnesses, 3.7–6.1 million medical visits, 82,000–170,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000–14,000 deaths in the United States.","Since SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the United States in early 2020, influenza activity has been lower than that seen before the pandemic. The adoption of COVID-19–related mitigation measures might have had an impact on the timing or severity of influenza activity. Compared with prepandemic influenza seasons, the 2021–22 influenza season was mild and occurred in two waves, with the second wave having a higher percentage of positive clinical laboratory test results and a higher number of hospitalizations than did the first. Influenza activity peaked later and remained at higher levels than had been reported in previous seasons in late April, May, and early June. During the 2021–22 season, peak percentage of positive influenza test results from clinical laboratories was the lowest in at least 25 years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, and the cumulative rate of influenza-associated hospitalizations was lower than that in all but the 2011–12 season, the mildest influenza season during the 10 years before the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimate of symptomatic illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by influenza virus infection in the United States during the 2021–22 season is also lower than estimates for any of the 10 influenza seasons preceding the pandemic. The lower level of influenza activity is not because of a decrease in testing for influenza; clinical laboratories reporting to CDC tested ≥1 million more specimens, and public health laboratories tested at least seven times as many specimens during the 2021–22 season than in any of the five seasons preceding the pandemic (2015–16 season to 2019–20 season). 

The first wave of influenza activity during the 2021–22 season peaked in mid-December throughout the country, but the timing of peak activity during the second wave varied by region, ranging from mid-March to May. Notably, the second wave peaked and influenza activity remained elevated nationally later than in any previous seasonal influenza epidemic. The predominant influenza virus throughout both waves was influenza A(H3N2) virus. Most of these viruses belonged to the 3C.2a1b.2a.2 subclade and were antigenically distinct from the reference viruses representing the egg-grown and cell-grown A(H3N2) vaccine components for the 2021–22 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines; however, based on preliminary vaccine effectiveness estimates, persons who were vaccinated during the 2021–22 season reduced their risk for influenza illness by approximately one third.§§§ The recommended A(H3N2) component for the 2022–23 influenza vaccine was updated to one that belongs to the 3C.2a1b.2a.2 subclade, the subclade that predominated in the United States during the 2021–22 season. All the influenza viruses collected and tested for antiviral resistance by CDC since October 3, 2022, were susceptible to zanamivir, and the majority (>99%) were susceptible to baloxavir, oseltamivir, and peramivir. 

Despite decreasing influenza activity in recent weeks, maintaining vigilance for influenza virus infections throughout the summer is important. Sporadic seasonal influenza virus infections and novel influenza A virus infections associated with exposure to swine during animal exhibitions are often reported during summer months (6). In addition, an ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus among birds during the 2021–22 season underscores the importance that providers and persons with exposure to sick or infected birds remain attentive to any new symptoms that could be consistent with influenza virus infection (7). Patients with suspected novel influenza A virus should isolate at home away from household members and refrain from going to work or school until they are proven to not be infected or have recovered from their illness. Specimens from patients with suspected novel influenza A virus infection should be collected and referred to state public health departments for testing, and treatment with influenza antiviral medications should be initiated immediately. Treatment is recommended and should be initiated as soon as possible for patients with confirmed or suspected seasonal or swine influenza virus infection who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at increased risk for influenza-associated complications (8). Influenza antiviral drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset and are recommended for use in the United States during the 2021–22 season. For persons aged ≥6 months, receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine each year remains the best way to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. 

Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted online weekly (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly).

PeV infections range from mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis to severe sepsis-like disease and central nervous system (CNS) infection, (1) and infants aged <3 months are disproportionately affected. PeV genotype 3 is responsible for the most severe cases, with a pattern of biannual cycle circulation that peaks during summer months (2,3). Although PeV infection is not a reportable disease, the Tennessee Department of Health was notified. An assessment of cases was conducted to better understand this unusually large cluster of infections. 

At this children’s hospital, a lumbar puncture is performed as part of sepsis evaluation for all infants aged <1 month and for older infants when clinically indicated. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing includes a multiplex molecular panel (BioFire FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel, bioMerieux) for all infants aged ≤3 months and for patients aged >3 months if the CSF white blood cell (WBC) count is >5 cells per high power field. For this investigation, a comprehensive review of electronic health records was conducted to assess demographic characteristics, social history, signs and symptoms at admission, laboratory test results, and treatment course of all patients in whom PeV was detected by the multiplex molecular panel during the cluster period. This study was reviewed and approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.† 

Median age of the patients was 24 days; 13 (57%) were female and 10 (43%) were male (Table). Five patients were preterm (28–36 weeks’ gestation). Signs and symptoms included fever, fussiness, and poor feeding. Most patients became symptomatic in the community (22, 96%); one preterm infant became symptomatic while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). One (4%) patient attended a child care facility, and 16 (70%) had siblings at home or were exposed to other children. 

Leukopenia was detected in only four (17%) patients. CSF cell count was performed for 22 patients; seven (32%) specimens demonstrated an elevated WBC count, including three with probable blood contamination during collection. All but one of the infants were admitted to the hospital; four (17%) infants developed severe disease that required treatment in the NICU. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed in four severely ill NICU patients, which detected diffusion within the white matter consistent with typical PeV meningoencephalitis in all of these patients. Antibiotics were initially prescribed for the 23 patients but were discontinued for 13 (57%) within 24 hours of detection of PeV. The mean hospital stay was 4.5 days (range = 1–26 days). Twenty-one (91.3%) patients recovered without complications. One patient was scheduled for a 6-month follow-up for possible late onset hearing loss and hypercoagulation evaluation. One patient experienced persistent seizures and was anticipated to experience severe developmental delay. 

The multiple molecular panel had been introduced at the children’s hospital in May 2018 to aid in the diagnosis of potential pathogens among patients with suspected meningitis or encephalitis. Nineteen cases were detected over 5 months in 2018, likely representing a baseline incidence of PeV CNS infections. Seven cases of PeV were detected during 2019–2021. The absence of a biennial peak in 2020 is presumably because of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that PeV transmission is closely associated with social activity. However, 29 cases were detected in 2022 at the children’s hospital, including the 23 cases described in this report that were detected within a 6-week period. This peak in infections might reflect relaxation of COVID-19 isolation measures, consistent with increased prevalence of other respiratory viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus)§ (4,5). When PeV is circulating, clinicians should consider testing for PeV in young infants, including those with normal CSF parameters.¶ The rapid detection of PeV in CSF by multiplex molecular panels can limit antibiotic administration and improve patient management. Parents with young infants, especially those with infants aged <3 months, should be aware of the symptoms and visit a pediatrician if symptoms persist.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Romney M.

During March 29–July 10, 2022, approximately 16.8 million persons in the United States aged ≥50 years received a fourth dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. 

What is added by this report? 

Among persons aged ≥50 years who reported homologous mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, injection site and systemic reactions were less frequent after a second booster dose than after the first booster dose. Ninety-five percent of 8,515 events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System were nonserious. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Health care providers and patients should be aware that local and systemic reactions are expected after a second mRNA COVID-19 booster dose. Serious adverse events are uncommon.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all persons aged ≥5 years receive 1 booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine after completion of their primary series.* On March 29, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized a second mRNA booster dose ≥4 months after receipt of a first booster dose for adults aged ≥50 years and persons aged ≥12 years with moderate to severe immunocompromise (1,2). To characterize the safety of a second mRNA booster dose among persons aged ≥50 years, CDC reviewed adverse events and health impact assessments reported to v-safe and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) after receipt of a second mRNA booster dose during March 29–July 10, 2022. V-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based U.S. active surveillance system that monitors adverse events occurring after COVID-19 vaccination. VAERS is a U.S. passive surveillance system for monitoring adverse events after vaccination, managed by CDC and FDA (3). During March 29–July 10, 2022, approximately 16.8 million persons in the United States aged ≥50 years received a fourth dose.† Among 286,380 v-safe registrants aged ≥50 years who reported receiving a second booster of an mRNA vaccine, 86.9% received vaccines from the same manufacturer for all 4 doses (i.e., homologous vaccination). Among registrants who reported homologous vaccination, injection site and systemic reactions were less frequent after the second booster dose than after the first booster dose. VAERS received 8,515 reports of adverse events after second mRNA booster doses among adults aged ≥50 years, including 8,073 (94.8%) nonserious and 442 (5.1%) serious events. CDC recommends that health care providers and patients be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after a second booster dose, and that serious adverse events are uncommon. 

The v-safe platform allows existing registrants to report receipt of a COVID-19 booster dose and new registrants to enter information about all doses received (https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/). Health surveys sent daily during the first week after administration of each dose include questions about local injection site and systemic reactions and health impacts.§ CDC’s v-safe call center contacts registrants who indicate that medical care was sought after vaccination and encourages completion of a VAERS report, if indicated. 

VAERS accepts reports of postvaccination adverse events from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public.¶ VAERS reports of hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death are classified as serious.** VAERS staff members assign Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms (MedDRA PTs) to the signs, symptoms, and diagnostic findings included in VAERS reports.†† Reports of serious events to VAERS were reviewed by CDC and FDA physicians to form a consensus clinical impression based on available data. For this analysis, death certificates and autopsy reports were requested for any report of death. CDC physicians reviewed all available information for each decedent to form an impression about the cause of death. For reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, rare adverse events that have been associated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, CDC sought information about the clinical course of each case and determined whether the CDC myocarditis case definition was met.§§ 

Local and systemic reactions and health impacts reported during the week after second booster dose vaccination were described for v-safe registrants aged ≥50 years who reported receiving a second booster during March 29–July 10, 2022, ≥4 months after their first booster dose; this analysis was further limited to registrants who received mRNA vaccines for all doses (both homologous and heterologous) and completed at least one daily health survey after receiving their second booster dose and at least one survey after a previous vaccine dose. Among registrants who received homologous mRNA vaccination, the odds of reporting an adverse reaction or health impact after receiving the second booster dose versus previous doses were compared using a multivariable generalized estimating equations model that accounted for demographic variables and repeated measures. Comparisons of adverse reactions and health impacts by vaccine dose were restricted to persons who received homologous mRNA vaccination because previous studies observed different patterns of reporting among recipients of heterologous mRNA and among recipients of homologous Ad26.COV2 (Johnson & Johnson [Janssen]) booster vaccination (4). VAERS adverse event reports after a second booster dose were described by serious and nonserious classification, demographic characteristics, and MedDRA PTs. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute); p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. These surveillance activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶ 

Review of v-safe Data 
During March 29–July 10, 2022, a total of 286,380 v-safe registrants aged ≥50 years reported receiving a second mRNA vaccine booster dose (homologous or heterologous). The median registrant age was 67 years; 173,525 (60.6%) were female. In the week after receipt of the second booster dose, local injection site reactions were reported by 67,521 (49.1%) BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and 92,472 (62.1%) mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine recipients; systemic reactions were reported by 60,705 (44.2%) Pfizer-BioNTech and 76,756 (51.5%) Moderna vaccine recipients (Table 1). Both local and systemic reactions were mostly mild to moderate in severity and were most frequently reported the day after vaccination. In the week after receipt of the second booster dose, 14,682 (10.7%) Pfizer-BioNTech and 22,385 (15.0%) Moderna vaccine recipients reported inability to complete normal daily activities; 4,300 (3.1%) Pfizer-BioNTech and 5,927 (4.0%) Moderna vaccine recipients reported inability to work or attend school. Receipt of medical care during the week after the second booster vaccination was reported by 0.8% and 0.7% of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine recipients, respectively; most received care via telehealth (0.2% and 0.3%, respectively) or clinic (0.3% and 0.2%, respectively) appointment. Hospitalization was reported by 81 (0.03%) registrants; 39 (48.1%) indicated that the hospitalization was unrelated to vaccination, 28 (34.6%) were unreachable or unwilling to provide additional information, and 14 (17.3%) completed a VAERS report. 

Among 248,887 (86.9%) v-safe registrants aged ≥50 years who received homologous vaccination and a second mRNA booster dose, local injection site reactions were less frequently reported after the second booster dose than after any previous doses (p<0.001); systemic reactions were less frequently reported after the second booster than after either dose 2 or the first booster dose (p<0.001) (Figure). Inability to complete normal daily activities, to work, or to attend school was less frequently reported after the homologous second booster dose than after either dose 2 or the first booster dose (p<0.001). Receipt of medical care was more frequently reported after the homologous Moderna second booster dose (0.7%) than the first booster dose (0.6%) (p<0.001) and more frequently reported after the second homologous Pfizer-BioNTech dose (0.8%) than the first booster dose (0.6%) (p<0.01). 

Review of VAERS Data 
During March 29–July 10, 2022, VAERS received and processed 8,515 reports of one or more adverse events after receipt of a second mRNA booster dose among adults aged ≥50 years (Table 2). The median age of these recipients was 68 years; 5,357 (62.9%) reports were for events among women. Most reports were for nonserious events (8,073; 94.8%), including 2,894 (35.8%) vaccination errors (e.g., expired product administered and product storage error); COVID-19 (2,111; 26.1%); and local and systemic reactions known to be associated with the vaccines and COVID-19, including fatigue (1,236; 15.3%), headache (1,047; 13.0%), and fever (975; 12.1%). Among the 2,894 reports indicating a vaccination error, only 388 (13.4%) also listed an adverse health event, including COVID-19 (74; 19.0%), injection site pain (69; 17.7%), and fever (63; 16.2%) (J. Baggs, PhD, CDC, personal communication, July 2022). 

Among the 8,515 VAERS reports of adverse events after receipt of a second mRNA booster dose among adults aged ≥50 years, 12 were preliminary reports of myocarditis (six nonserious and six serious); one case was verified by medical record review and met the CDC case definition for myocarditis; the patient was continuing to recover at time of this report. 

Among the 442 (5.2%) reports of serious events after second mRNA booster vaccination among adults aged ≥50 years 52 were reports of death; the median age of decedents was 84 years. For the six reports of death with sufficient information, cause of death as stated on the death certificate included congestive heart failure, aortic dissection, grand mal seizure, end-stage dementia, and cardiac arrest secondary to coronary artery disease. Among the serious events reported, 84 were of COVID-19 (19.0%). 

","Limited data are available regarding the safety of second COVID-19 booster doses. The findings in this report are consistent with those from a small open-label clinical study of second boosters (154 participants received Pfizer-BioNTech and 120 Moderna vaccines) that did not detect any unexpected safety concerns (5). Among 248,887 v-safe registrants aged ≥50 years with homologous vaccination and a second booster dose, injection site and systemic reactions were less frequently reported after the second booster dose than the first booster dose. Similarly, adverse reactions after a first booster dose were less common than were those after dose 2 of the primary series among v-safe registrants aged ≥18 years (4) and clinical trial subjects (6,7). In general, reactions were less frequently reported by v-safe registrants aged ≥50 years after a second booster dose than by adults aged ≥18 years after a first booster dose (4); this difference is not unexpected because v-safe participants aged ≥65 years are less likely to report reactions after COVID-19 vaccination than are younger adults (8). Overall, 94.8% of VAERS reports were nonserious and vaccine administration errors represented approximately one third of nonserious reports; 13.4% of these also listed an adverse health event. Among both nonserious and serious reports to VAERS, COVID-19 was the most commonly reported event; this is not unexpected given the current epidemiology of the pandemic. 

Health care providers are required to report any death that occurs after COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS regardless of whether death has any association with vaccination. Among 40 reports of death after second booster doses, the median decedent age exceeded the median age for all VAERS reports. Reporting rates for death after primary COVID-19 vaccination were higher among adults aged ≥50, consistent with general age-specific mortality rates in the adult population (9). After review of available information (six of 40 reports), no vaccine-associated deaths were identified in these reports. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, v-safe is a voluntary reporting program and only 286,380 of the 16.8 million persons aged ≥50 years who received a fourth dose during this period reported receipt to v-safe; therefore, data might not be representative of the entire vaccinated U.S. population. Second, vaccine recipients who experience an adverse event could be more likely to respond to v-safe surveys. Third, VAERS is a passive system and is subject to reporting biases and underreporting, especially of nonserious events (3). Fourth, medical review of reported deaths after vaccination is dependent on availability of medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports, which might be unavailable or not available in a timely manner. Finally, a report to v-safe or VAERS alone cannot be used to assess causality. 

ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥5 years receive one booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine after completion of their primary series; adults aged ≥50 years and persons aged ≥12 years with moderate to severe immunocompromise might receive a second booster ≥4 months after their first booster dose. Among adults aged ≥50 years, vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-associated hospitalization ≥120 days after dose 3 was 55% and ≥7 days after dose 4 was 80%, reinforcing recommendations that persons in this age group should receive a second booster when they become eligible (10). Preliminary safety findings after receipt of second booster doses among adults aged ≥50 years are similar to those after receipt of first booster doses. Reports of reactions after the second booster dose are less common than are those after the first. Health care providers and patients should be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after second booster doses and that serious adverse events are infrequently reported. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates as needed to guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations

Little is known about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) during the Omicron variant BA.2/BA.2.12.2–predominant period or VE of a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose in persons aged ≥50 years.

What is added by this report?

VE during the BA.2/BA.2.12.2 period was lower than that during the BA.1 period. A third vaccine dose provided additional protection against moderate and severe COVID-19–associated illness in all age groups, and a fourth dose provided additional protection in eligible adults aged ≥50 years.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Immunocompetent persons should receive recommended COVID-19 booster doses to prevent moderate to severe COVID-19, including a first booster dose for all eligible persons and second dose for adults aged ≥50 years at least 4 months after an initial booster dose. Booster doses should be obtained immediately when persons become eligible.

The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was first identified in the United States in November 2021, with the BA.1 sublineage (including BA.1.1) causing the largest surge in COVID-19 cases to date. Omicron sublineages BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 emerged later and by late April 2022, accounted for most cases.* Estimates of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) can be reduced by newly emerging variants or sublineages that evade vaccine-induced immunity (1), protection from previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in unvaccinated persons (2), or increasing time since vaccination (3). Real-world data comparing VE during the periods when the BA.1 and BA.2/BA.2.12.1 predominated (BA.1 period and BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, respectively) are limited. The VISION network† examined 214,487 emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) visits and 58,782 hospitalizations with a COVID-19–like illness§ diagnosis among 10 states during December 18, 2021–June 10, 2022, to evaluate VE of 2, 3, and 4 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) compared with no vaccination among adults without immunocompromising conditions. VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization 7–119 days and ≥120 days after receipt of dose 3 was 92% (95% CI = 91%–93%) and 85% (95% CI = 81%–89%), respectively, during the BA.1 period, compared with 69% (95% CI = 58%–76%) and 52% (95% CI = 44%–59%), respectively, during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period. Patterns were similar for ED/UC encounters. Among adults aged ≥50 years, VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization ≥120 days after receipt of dose 3 was 55% (95% CI = 46%–62%) and ≥7 days (median = 27 days) after a fourth dose was 80% (95% CI = 71%–85%) during BA.2/BA.2.12.1 predominance. Immunocompetent persons should receive recommended COVID-19 booster doses to prevent moderate to severe COVID-19, including a first booster dose for all eligible persons and second booster dose for adults aged ≥50 years at least 4 months after an initial booster dose. Booster doses should be obtained immediately when persons become eligible.¶

A 2-dose primary COVID-19 mRNA vaccination series followed by a third (booster) dose at least 5 months after dose 2 is recommended for adults aged ≥18 years without immunocompromising conditions. On March 29, 2022, an additional booster dose (dose 4) was authorized for immunocompetent adults aged ≥50 years at least 4 months after dose 3 (4). The VISION Network evaluated the effectiveness of 2, 3, or 4 mRNA vaccine doses during December 2021–June 2022, a period during which different sublineages of Omicron circulated in the United States. VISION methods have been described previously (5); briefly, eligible medical encounters include ED/UC visits and hospitalizations among adults with COVID-19–like illness and a SARS-CoV-2 molecular test during the 14 days before through 72 hours after the encounter. Variant predominance was defined as the period when a variant accounted for ≥75% of all sequenced specimens at a site (i.e., BA.1, December 2021–March 2022** and BA.2/BA.2.12.1, March–June 2022††). Dates when the prevalence of BA.1 declined to <75% of sequenced specimens and the prevalence of BA.2/BA.2.12.1 had not yet reached 75% were considered a “washout” period; encounters through June 10, 2022, were included unless BA.2/BA.2.12.1 prevalence declined to <75% at a site before that date. Patients were excluded if 1) a medical event occurred during the washout period; 2) a likely immunocompromising condition was present; 3) an mRNA vaccine dose was received before it was recommended§§; 4) any doses of a non–mRNA vaccine such as JNJ-78436735 (Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]) were received; 5) <14 days had elapsed since receipt of dose 2 or <7 days since receipt of dose 3 or dose 4; or 6) a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented in the patient’s medical record before the index encounter (to reduce the influence of protection from previous infection).¶¶ VE was estimated using a test-negative case-control design, comparing the odds of being vaccinated (receipt of 2 doses ≥14 days before the encounter, 3 doses ≥7 days before the encounter, or 4 doses ≥7 days before the encounter) versus being unvaccinated (zero doses received) between persons with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results, using multivariable logistic regression, weighted for inverse propensity to be vaccinated, and adjusted for age, calendar time of index date (days since January 1, 2021),*** study site, and local virus circulation. VE for 4 vaccine doses was assessed only for adults aged ≥50 years during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, aligning with the March 29, 2022, authorization for the fourth dose. Nonoverlapping 95% CIs were considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.2; R Foundation). The study was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards at participating sites or under reliance agreement with the institutional review board of Westat, Inc. This activity was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.†††

Among 214,487 ED/UC encounters with a COVID-19–like illness diagnosis that met inclusion criteria, 124,033 (57.8%) occurred during the BA.1 period, during which 40,801 (32.9%) patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; 90,454 (42.2%) occurred during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, during which 10,177 (11.3%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. During the BA.1 period, 51,359 (41.4%) ED/UC patients were unvaccinated, 40,026 (32.3%) had received 2 mRNA vaccine doses, and 32,648 (26.3%) had received 3 doses (Table 1). During the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, 27,907 (30.9%) ED/UC patients were unvaccinated; 22,657 (25.0%) had received 2 mRNA vaccine doses, 35,796 (39.6%) had received 3 doses; and 4,094 (4.5%) had received 4 doses. Receipt of 3 versus 2 doses was associated with a higher VE against an ED/UC encounter during both periods, and VE was higher during the BA.1 period than the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period (Table 2). During the BA.1 period, VE declined to 73% ≥120 days (median = 132 days) after the third vaccine dose; during the BA.2/BA.12.1 period, VE declined to 26% at ≥120 days (median = 166 days) after the third dose.

Among 58,782 hospitalizations with a COVID-19–like illness diagnosis that met inclusion criteria, 35,399 (60.2%) occurred during the BA.1 period, during which 10,534 (29.8%) patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result; 23,383 (17.9%) occurred during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, during which 1,564 (6.7%) patients had a positive test result (Table 3). During the BA.1 period, 14,742 (41.6%) patients hospitalized with COVID-19–like illness were unvaccinated, 10,086 (28.5%) had received 2 mRNA vaccine doses, and 10,571 (29.9%) had received 3 doses. During the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, 6,682 (28.6%) patients hospitalized with COVID-19–like illness were unvaccinated, and 5,461 (23.4%), 10,036 (42.9%), and 1,204 (5.1%) had received 2, 3, and 4 mRNA vaccine doses, respectively. VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was 61% ≥150 days after dose 2 during the BA.1 period (median = 289 days) compared with 24% during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period (median = 371 days) (Table 2). VE associated with a third mRNA vaccine dose was higher than that associated with a second vaccine dose but declined during both periods at ≥120 days to 85% during the BA.1 period (median = 132 days) and 52% during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period (median = 168 days).

Among adults aged ≥50 years eligible to receive a fourth mRNA vaccine dose, VE for COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period was 32% at ≥120 days after the third dose (median interval = 170 days) but increased to 66% ≥7 days after the fourth dose (median interval = 28 days). VE against COVID-19–associated hospitalization was 55% ≥120 days after the third dose but increased to 80% ≥7 days after the fourth dose.

","Data from the Omicron BA.1 sublineage surge in the United States during December 2021–February 2022 determined that VE was reduced compared with that during the previous Delta-predominant period (6). To date, estimates of differences in VE between the Omicron BA.1 and subsequent BA.2/BA.2.12.1 sublineage periods have been limited. In this estimate of VE against ED/UC visits and hospitalizations during the BA.1 and BA.2/BA.2.12.1 periods, VE declined during both periods ≥150 days after the second vaccine dose, highlighting the need for a third dose (i.e., the first booster) for eligible adults. Recent receipt of a third dose increased VE; however, some decline was observed ≥120 days after receipt of the dose. Among eligible adults aged ≥50 years, a fourth vaccine dose ≥120 days after receipt of the third dose improved VE during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, although follow-up time after dose 4 was limited. These findings highlight the importance of staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including recommended booster doses. 

Although data on neutralizing antibodies have found BA.1 and BA.2 to be similar, recent data indicate slightly more immune escape for BA.2.12.1 (1). Data reported on Omicron sublineage VE have been limited. A study in the United Kingdom found inconsistent differences in VE for symptomatic COVID-19 and COVID-19–associated hospitalization, with higher VE against symptomatic COVID-19 but larger declines in VE against hospitalization observed during a period of BA.2 predominance versus a period of BA.1 predominance starting 10–14 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose (7). A study in Qatar found that after a second or third mRNA vaccine dose, declines in VE against symptomatic COVID-19 during BA.1 and BA.2 periods were similar, but the study did not identify enough severe cases to separate VE estimates by predominant variant (8). Differences between the current study and previous studies, including differences in proportions of persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and the absence of BA.2.12.1 infections outside the United States might account for some variability in findings. After the BA.1 surge in the United States, a larger proportion of adults were found to have experienced a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period, with antibody evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection increasing from 33.5% in December 2021 to 57.7% by February 2022 (9). Unvaccinated persons were used as a referent group in VE analyses. If unvaccinated persons were more likely to have experienced recent infection, and infection-induced immunity provides some protection against re-infection, this could result in lower VE observed during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period. Although adults with documented past SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded, infections are likely to be significantly underascertained because of lack of testing or increased at-home testing (10). In addition, although time since receipt of the second or third vaccine dose was stratified by time intervals, on average the time since vaccination was longer during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period. These differences were particularly pronounced in the analysis of ≥150 days after the second vaccine dose (median 289 days for hospitalized adults during the BA.1 period compared to 371 days during the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 period), which could account for some differences in VE estimates and highlights the importance of a third dose (first booster) for those who have not yet received it. 

The findings in this analysis are subject to at least four limitations. First, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely underascertained and might differentially affect observed VE during the BA.1 and BA.2/BA.2.12.1 periods. Second, residual confounding in VE estimates is possible. Third, no genetic characterization was available for SARS-CoV-2–positive specimens; therefore, date of testing was used to ascribe likely sublineage, and BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 sublineages were combined, given their overlap in circulation. Finally, this report did not assess VE against the most severe COVID-19–associated disease (e.g., respiratory failure) because of smaller numbers of these cases. 

VE should continue to be monitored in the setting of newly emerging sublineages and variants, including Omicron sublineages BA.4 and BA.5, which became predominant in the United States in late June 2022. Eligible adults should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, including a first booster dose for all eligible persons and second booster dose for adults aged ≥50 years. Booster doses should be obtained immediately when persons become eligible.

In 2021, state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) public health workers reported high levels of symptoms of at least one mental health condition (depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]). 

What is added by this report? 

In a 2022 survey of 26,069 STLT public health workers, higher PTSD prevalence was associated with more weekly work hours and more time spent on COVID-19 response activities. Most (75.5%) respondents did not think their employer increased mental health support. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

To support the mental health of public health workers, public health agencies can modify work-related factors, including making organizational changes for emergency responses and facilitating access to mental health resources and services.

An increase in adverse mental health symptoms occurred in the general population at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which peaked in 2020 and subsequently decreased (1–3). The pandemic exacerbated existing stress and fatigue among public health workers responding to the public health crisis.* During March–April 2021, a survey of state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) public health workers found that 52.8% of respondents experienced symptoms of at least one of the following mental health conditions: depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (4); however, more recent estimates of mental health symptoms among this population are limited. To evaluate trends in these conditions from the previous year, the prevalence of symptoms of mental health conditions and suicidal ideation, a convenience sample of STLT public health workers was surveyed during March 14–25, 2022. In total, 26,069 STLT public health workers responded to the survey. Among respondents,† 6,090 (27.7%) reported symptoms of depression, 6,467 (27.9%) anxiety, 6,324 (28.4%) PTSD, and 1,853 (8.1%) suicidal ideation. Although the prevalences of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among public health workers were lower (p<0.001)§ among 2022 survey respondents compared with those of 2021 survey respondents (4), the prevalences of symptoms of suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, and PTSD remained high among those who worked >60 hours per week (range = 11.3%–45.9%) and those who spent ≥76% of their work time on COVID-19 response activities (range = 9.0%–37.6%). Respondents were less likely to report mental health symptoms if they could take time off (prevalence ratio [PR] range = 0.48–0.55), or if they perceived an increase in mental health resources from their employer (PR range = 0.58–0.84). To support the mental health of public health workers, public health agencies can modify work-related factors, including making organizational changes for emergency responses and facilitating access to mental health resources and services.¶ 

During March 14–25, 2022, a nonprobability-based, self-administered, anonymous, web-based survey was disseminated to a convenience sample of public health workers who worked in U.S. STLT health departments for at least part of 2021.** The electronic survey link was distributed via email to national public health membership organizations, which shared the link with approximately 27,000 members with the request that members in a supervisory role cascade the survey to all public health workers within their respective organizations.†† The survey included questions on demographic characteristics, work history, traumatic events or stressors experienced since March 2021, employer-provided resources, and self-reported mental health symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or suicidal ideation within the previous 2 weeks. A similar convenience sample approach, survey instrument, and methodology were used in March 2021 (4). Mental health conditions were defined using validated instruments to evaluate symptoms of anxiety (2-item General Anxiety Disorder [GAD-2] questionnaire), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), and PTSD (6-item Impact of Event Scale [IES-6])§§ (4). One item from PHQ-9 was used to evaluate suicidal ideation.¶¶ Prevalences of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicidal ideation were stratified by demographic characteristics, workplace factors, stressors experienced, and coping mechanisms. Bivariate PRs of the four mental health conditions were calculated separately using Poisson regression with 95% CIs. Response frequencies from the 2021 and the 2022 surveys were tabulated, and prevalences (percentages) and 95% CIs of mental health outcomes were compared. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute); p<0.05 or CIs for the PR that exclude 1.0 were considered statistically significant. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*** 

Overall, approximately one half of respondents (48.0% [95% CI = 47.3%–48.7%]) (A Koné, CDC, unpublished data, 2022) experienced symptoms of at least one of the mental health conditions of depression, anxiety, or PTSD.††† The most commonly reported mental health condition was PTSD (28.4%) followed by anxiety (27.9%), depression (27.7%), and suicidal ideation (8.1%) (Table 1). The prevalences of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among public health workers were lower (−3.1%, −2.4%, and −8.4%, respectively) (p<0.001) among 2022 survey respondents compared with 2021 survey respondents (4). Respondents who identified as multiple races reported the highest prevalences of symptoms of depression (31.4%), anxiety (33.5%), and PTSD (34.4%) compared with other races. Most (91.4%) respondents worked ≥1 year in public health. Respondents who had spent ≥76% of work time on COVID-19 response activities were more likely to experience depression (PR = 1.38), anxiety (PR = 1.35), and PTSD (PR = 2.43), compared with public health workers not working on COVID-19. Respondents who worked >60 hours per week were more likely than were respondents working ≤40 hours per week to experience depression (PR = 1.73), anxiety (PR = 1.48), PTSD (PR = 2.07), and suicidal ideation (PR = 1.50). The percentage of symptoms of mental health conditions and suicidal ideation increased with the percentage of time working on COVID-19 response activities, especially among those who spent ≥76% of their work time on COVID-19 (range = 9.0%–37.6%) and for those who worked >60 hours per week (range = 11.3%–45.9%). This difference was most notable for PTSD in both 2021 and 2022 (Table 2). In 2021, among public health workers who had spent ≥76% of work time on COVID-19 response activities and worked ≤40, 41–60, and >60 hours per week, the prevalences of PTSD were 35.8%, 47.3%, and 58.7%, respectively, representing increases of 70.5%, 82.6%, and 109.6%, respectively, over those among public health workers not working on COVID-19. In addition, compared with 2021, the PRs for PTSD increased in 2022 for respondents who worked >60 hours per week and spent any time on COVID-19 activities: among those who spent 1%–25%, 26%–50%, 51%–75%, and ≥76% of time on COVID-19 activities, PTSD PRs during 2021 and 2022 were 1.14 and 1.39, 1.02 and 1.67, 1.67 and 2.19, and 2.10 and 2.48, respectively. 

Since March 2022, respondents who reported feeling overwhelmed by workload or family and work balance were 2.35, 2.67, 2.90, and 2.98 times as likely to report symptoms of suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively, as were those not reporting feeling overwhelmed (Table 3). Public health workers who received job-related threats or felt bullied, threatened, or harassed because of their job reported the highest prevalences of PTSD (53.3% and 47.7%, respectively). Approximately one quarter of respondents (27.8%) who have left or were considering leaving public health were approximately twice as likely to report suicidal ideation (PR = 2.34) compared with those staying in the field. In addition, 73.9% of public health workers knew colleagues who left or were considering leaving public health. A total of 16,462 (75.4%) respondents were able to take time off from work. Public health workers who could take time off from work were less likely to report symptoms of depression (PR = 0.50), anxiety (PR = 0.55), PTSD (PR = 0.51), or suicidal ideation (PR = 0.48) compared with those unable to take time off. According to 75.5% of public health workers, their employer had not increased support for staff members’ mental health since March 2021. Respondents who reported an increase in mental health resources were less likely than were those who did not to report symptoms of depression (PR = 0.68), anxiety (PR = 0.71), PTSD (PR = 0.84), and suicidal ideation (PR = 0.58). Among public health workers who did perceive an increase in mental health resources, those considered to be most useful were demonstrating appreciation for staff members’ work (63.4%), telework options (58.2%), and flexible work schedules (55.0%) (A Koné, CDC, unpublished data, 2022).","Public health workers who spent more time on COVID-19 response activities were more likely to report mental health symptoms, including PTSD. Compared with results of the 2021 survey of STLT public health workers (4), in 2022, prevalence of PTSD was 15.7% lower among public health workers who worked >60 hours per week and spent ≥76% on COVID-19. However, the PRs increased, and the prevalence of PTSD (49.5%) was higher for this group than the overall prevalence of PTSD (28.4%). Previous studies have documented that persons who work long hours are susceptible to experiencing negative mental health or physiologic outcomes (5,6). 

Prolonged exposure to occupational stressors can lead to adverse mental health conditions and has been linked with high health care worker turnover during the COVID-19 pandemic (7,8). Respondents who left or were considering leaving public health were more likely to report symptoms of mental health conditions and suicidal ideation. Approximately three quarters of public health workers did not perceive an increase in employer-based mental health resources for staff members. According to the 2021 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey, public health workers were considering leaving their employment because of burnout, stress, and organizational culture (9). In addition, in the 2022 CDC survey of public health workers, respondents who expressed feeling bullied or threatened reported some of the highest prevalences of symptoms of mental health conditions and suicidal ideation. It is therefore important that public health agencies identify risk factors for workplace violence, recognize signs that public health workers are being bullied or threatened, and implement strategies to prevent and address these incidents.§§§ 

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, the respondents were drawn from a nonprobability-based convenience sample of STLT public health workers who employed partial snowball sampling; thus, these findings are not generalizable to and might not represent the entire STLT public health workforce. Second, because of the survey distribution method and an approximation of the number of public health workers (range = 231,464–341,053) (10), a true response rate cannot be calculated. Third, although validated instruments were used to score respondents’ mental health symptoms, the score does not confirm a clinical diagnosis of a mental health disorder (4). Fourth, the data are subject to recall bias; some questions asked respondents to recall experiences since March 2021. Fifth, data came from cross-sectional surveys; therefore, the findings do not reflect changes in symptoms among the same persons over time. Finally, a multivariable analysis was not conducted, and it is possible that observed differences between surveys could be because of demographic or other variations between the two samples. 

It is critical for public health agencies to invest in and develop their STLT public health workforce to address mental health, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicidal ideation. Investment in the current and future workforces might include training organizational leaders and supervisors to recognize, understand, and support staff members’ mental health needs. Organization-led initiatives, including reducing the number of hours or percentage of time public health workers work on an emergency response might also improve workforce health.","Corresponding author: Ahoua Koné, qws5@cdc.gov.","Suggested citation for this article: Koné A, Horter L, Thomas I, et al.

Toxoplasmosis, a zoonotic parasitic disease that can result in severe adverse outcomes, is not a nationally notifiable illness in the United States; no national level surveillance data are available. 

What is added by this report? 

In 2021, toxoplasmosis was reportable in eight states. Among six states that participated in a surveillance evaluation, case definitions varied considerably, and a need for development and implementation of a standardized case definition was identified. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Implementing a standardized case definition would help ensure that cases are counted consistently. Toxoplasmosis surveillance could increase awareness among physicians and public health personnel but is dependent upon health department resources. Identifying newly acquired cases is important for surveillance but is challenging because most acute cases among immunocompetent persons (including pregnant women) are asymptomatic, disease among immunocompromised persons are likely reactivations of latent disease, and congenital infections might not manifest until later in life.

Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the zoonotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Although disease tends to be mild (e.g., self-limiting influenza-like symptoms) or asymptomatic in immunocompetent persons, toxoplasmosis is more severe in immunocompromised persons, who can develop potentially fatal encephalopathy (1). In addition, primary infections acquired during pregnancy might result in a range of adverse outcomes, including fetal ocular infection, cranial and neurologic deformities, stillbirth, and miscarriage (1,2). An estimated 11% of the U.S. population aged ≥6 years are seropositive for toxoplasmosis, based on analysis of sera collected through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2011–2014 (3). Toxoplasmosis is not a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, and currently no national public health surveillance data are available; however, it is reportable in eight states. To better understand how surveillance data are collected and used, reviews of state-level toxoplasmosis surveillance were conducted during June–July 2021 using semistructured interviews with health officials in six states (Arkansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) where toxoplasmosis is currently reportable. Why or when toxoplasmosis became reportable could not be determined, and many of the states had limited capacity to respond to reported cases. Case definitions varied considerably in terms of clinical description, laboratory criteria, and case classification (i.e., confirmed, probable, or suspect), limiting disease estimates and comparisons among states. Implementation of a standardized case definition would help ensure that cases are counted consistently, enabling better use of surveillance data to characterize disease. Identifying newly acquired cases is challenging because most acute cases among immunocompetent persons (including pregnant women) are asymptomatic, disease among immunocompromised persons is likely reactivation of latent disease, and congenital infections might not manifest until later in life. 

Members of the family Felidae (cats) are definitive hosts for T. gondii. Humans can be infected through various routes, including fecal-oral contamination from cats; consumption of undercooked contaminated meat, contaminated unwashed fruits or vegetables, contaminated water, and unpasteurized milk; vertical transmission from an infected mother; and organ transplantation. Toxoplasmosis is likely underdiagnosed in the United States: approximately 90% of infections among immunocompetent persons are asymptomatic or nonspecific and self-limiting (1); when symptoms are present, they can potentially mimic other more frequently encountered illnesses, including influenza and tickborne-diseases such as Lyme disease or anaplasmosis; thus, physician awareness and clinical suspicion of toxoplasmosis might be low, resulting in delays in or missed opportunities for diagnosis and case identification (4,5). No national maternal toxoplasmosis screening program currently exists, and most infants born with congenital toxoplasmosis appear normal at birth (1,2). Because reactivation of toxoplasmosis during immunocompromise can be rapidly fatal, and outcomes of congenital infection can be severe, toxoplasmosis surveillance could help improve awareness and understanding of disease prevalence and transmission routes and identify opportunities for prevention and control. 

States where toxoplasmosis is reportable were identified using the State Reportable Conditions Assessment query tool on the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) website* and supplemented by reviewing reportable diseases lists accessed from state health department websites for inclusion of toxoplasmosis. A modified version of a qualitative questionnaire used for Chagas disease surveillance (6) was developed to identify why toxoplasmosis was designated a reportable condition in the state, how cases are reported and by whom, what actions are taken after case identification, how surveillance data are used and disseminated, whether nonhuman data are collected and used, and whether formal toxoplasmosis maternal screening programs are in place (6). State public health veterinarians were contacted by email and invited to participate either by telephone or virtual interview or to complete the questionnaire. The purpose and scope of the project, as well as a copy of the questionnaire, were included in this initial email. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and policy.† 

As of April 2021, toxoplasmosis is reportable in eight states (Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin); among these states, public health personnel from six (Arkansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) agreed to participate and were interviewed. The historic dates when toxoplasmosis became reportable and the reasons for initiating surveillance could not be determined. Toxoplasmosis had been reportable for as long as could be remembered and reviewing historical case data could not further elucidate a starting date. Several possible reasons were suggested for why toxoplasmosis was made reportable, including monitoring disease prevalence, a need to identify the source of infection, the effect of toxoplasmosis on pregnancy, congenital transmission, and outbreak identification. In addition, whether any substantial changes had occurred in how surveillance data were collected since toxoplasmosis became reportable also could not be determined. 

Case definitions were provided by the states and varied considerably in both clinical and laboratory criteria and how cases are classified (Table). Variations in clinical descriptions included a separate description for immunocompromised persons (all states except Arkansas and Minnesota); a separate description for infection acquired during pregnancy (Kentucky, Nebraska, and Wisconsin); further separation based on timing of infection during pregnancy (early versus late; Pennsylvania); and a category for chronic infection status (Minnesota). Signs and symptoms used in each clinical description category were similar but not consistent. Variations in laboratory criteria included whether paired or sequential antibody testing was confirmatory (all states except Arkansas and Pennsylvania); single antibody titers as presumptive/suggestive criteria (Arkansas and Kentucky); criteria for congenital infection in infants (Kentucky, Nebraska, and Wisconsin); and a criterion that included testing at a reference laboratory (Minnesota). Among the variations in case classification were that Nebraska and Wisconsin had only a “confirmed” case classification and no “probable” classification, Pennsylvania also included a “suspect” classification, and Minnesota’s case classifications specified “confirmed,” “probable,” and “chronic.” 

After notification of a case, all states attempt to investigate to determine exposure and clinical history; however, investigation depends on resource availability. Laboratories are the primary reporting source in all states, although physicians might also report cases. No state reported having formal maternal screening programs for toxoplasmosis; however, maternal screening is frequently recorded as the reason for testing on case report forms submitted to the state health department (Minnesota). No states collected nonhuman data as a routine part of toxoplasmosis surveillance. The Nebraska state public health veterinarian indicated that their office receives data from the state veterinary diagnostic laboratory about toxoplasmosis diagnosed in animals. Although such reports contain the animal owner’s city and zip code, they do not name the owner and are not formally integrated with the human case surveillance program. 

Dissemination of surveillance data occurs through public reports posted to state health department websites (Arkansas, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) or updates to toxoplasmosis case counts in annual disease tables available on the state health department website (Kentucky). In two states (Nebraska and Pennsylvania), reports are distributed internally within the agency, but not externally.","Standardized surveillance case definitions provide a common, accepted set of criteria to ensure that cases of disease are classified and counted consistently, irrespective of jurisdiction.§ Surveillance data provide an evidence base about disease prevalence, including who is affected, where, and how, to guide the development, implementation, funding, monitoring, and evaluation of disease control activities¶ (7). 

Important differences were identified in case classifications and laboratory and clinical criteria used in surveillance case definitions, making it difficult to compare case counts or disease prevalence among states. Toxoplasmosis poses unique challenges for public health surveillance, primarily in identifying acute illnesses, which are the more important target for public health action (e.g., identifying and mitigating the source of infection). Once infected, persons are presumed to remain infected for life (even with treatment**) and likely maintain detectable antibody levels, even without reverting to or showing signs of active disease (latent or chronic infections) (1). Toxoplasmosis among immunocompromised persons more commonly represents reactivation of latent infection rather than newly acquired infection (1). Congenital infections might not manifest until later in life. Commercially available serology assays, which typically examine immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibody levels, cannot reliably differentiate between acute and chronic infection: IgM antibodies might remain elevated for ≥18 months after infection (8), and IgG might be present during acute infections (9). A combination of advanced serologic tests, such as IgG avidity testing or IgA or IgE antibody levels, available only through a reference laboratory,†† are necessary to serologically differentiate between acute and chronic infection. Direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction or histologic examination of tissue sections or smears of body fluid are more definitive in demonstrating active infection but are most useful in immunocompromised patients (1). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, only six of the eight states that conduct toxoplasmosis surveillance participated in the assessment; case definitions or processes for toxoplasmosis surveillance in Delaware or Hawaii were not able to be reviewed. Because of the length of time toxoplasmosis has been reportable in these states, most historic questions could not be answered. Second, this evaluation was conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant surge of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which might have affected staff member availability to gather historical information on procedures for toxoplasmosis investigation and response. 

Developing and implementing a standardized case definition in states where toxoplasmosis is reportable could help ensure that surveillance data are collected in a standardized way and establish common goals for surveillance. As a result of this review, the participating states have decided to proactively develop a CSTE position statement for a standardized surveillance case definition for toxoplasmosis.","Corresponding author: Anne Straily, astraily@cdc.gov, 404-718-1422.","Suggested citation for this article: McCall J, Rothfeldt L, Giesbrecht K, et al.

Drug overdose deaths increased 30% in the United States from 2019 to 2020. Known health disparities exist in overdose mortality rates, particularly among certain racial/ethnic minority populations. 

What is added by this report? 

From 2019 to 2020, overdose death rates increased by 44% and 39% among non-Hispanic Black (Black) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons, respectively. As county-level income inequality increased, overdose rates increased, particularly among Black persons. Evidence of previous substance use treatment was lowest for Black decedents (8.3%). 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Implementation of an evidence-based, culturally responsive, multisectoral approach is critical to reducing disparities in overdose rates. This includes addressing structural barriers and enhancing efforts such as linkage to care and harm reduction services.

Abstract 
Introduction: Drug overdose deaths increased approximately 30% from 2019 to 2020 in the United States. Examining rates by demographic and social determinants of health characteristics can identify disproportionately affected populations and inform strategies to reduce drug overdose deaths. 

Methods: Data from the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) were used to analyze overdose death rates from 2019 to 2020 in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Rates were examined by race and ethnicity and county-level social determinants of health (e.g., income inequality and treatment provider availability). 

Results: From 2019 to 2020, drug overdose death rates increased by 44% and 39% among non-Hispanic Black (Black) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons, respectively. Significant disparities were found across sex, age, and racial and ethnic subgroups. In particular, the rate in 2020 among Black males aged ≥65 years (52.6 per 100,000) was nearly seven times that of non-Hispanic White males aged ≥65 years (7.7). A history of substance use was frequently reported. Evidence of previous substance use treatment was lowest for Black persons (8.3%). Disparities in overdose deaths, particularly among Black persons, were larger in counties with greater income inequality. Opioid overdose rates in 2020 were higher in areas with more opioid treatment program availability compared with areas with lower opioid treatment availability, particularly among Black (34.3 versus 16.6) and AI/AN (33.4 versus 16.2) persons. 

Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Health disparities in overdose rates continue to worsen, particularly among Black and AI/AN persons; social determinants of health, such as income inequality, exacerbate these inequities. Implementation of available, evidence-based, culturally responsive overdose prevention and response efforts that address health disparities impacting disproportionately affected populations are urgently needed. 

Introduction 
The 91,799 drug overdose deaths that occurred in the United States in 2020 represent an approximately 30% increase from 2019 (1). The COVID-19 pandemic and disruption in access to prevention, treatment, and harm reduction services have likely contributed to this increase (2). Recent increases in drug overdose deaths were largely driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs (collectively referred to as IMFs) (1,3,4). Deaths involving stimulants, such as cocaine and psychostimulants with abuse potential, (e.g., methamphetamine) also increased in recent years and often co-occurred with opioids (1,3,5,6); some racial and ethnic minority groups were disproportionately affected (6). 

Disparities in overdose mortality rates are not fully explained by substance use patterns (7,8) and might result from unequal access to substance use treatment services (9), socioeconomic inequities, and social determinants of health (10). Non-Hispanic Black (Black) and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons report barriers to accessing mental health services and substance use treatment (9). However, the impact of treatment access and income inequality on drug overdose mortality has not been fully explored, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated disparities (11). 

This report describes changes in drug overdose death rates from 2019 to 2020, stratified by sex, age group, and race and ethnicity. In addition, it examines differences in circumstances surrounding drug overdose, and assesses differences in overdose death rates by county-level income inequality and availability of mental health treatment providers and providers of medications for opioid use disorder. 

Methods 
Data on drug overdose deaths of unintentional and undetermined intent during 2019–2020 were obtained from the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS). This system includes information collected from death certificates and medical examiner or coroner reports (e.g., full postmortem toxicology results and death scene investigation findings).* Analyses were limited to 26 jurisdictions (25 states and the District of Columbia [DC]) that submitted complete 2019–2020 data.† Death rates (overdose deaths per 100,000 population) were age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population, and rate ratios were calculated.§ U.S. Census Bureau bridged-race population estimates were assessed for the following racial and ethnic groups: non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI), AI/AN, Black, non-Hispanic White (White), and Hispanic persons. Rates based on <20 deaths and counts <10 were suppressed. 

Information on income inequality and mental health provider availability (number of mental health providers per 100,000 population) was obtained from the 2021 County Health Rankings and analyzed by tertile.¶ The Drug Enforcement Administration’s controlled substance registration database was used to ascertain whether a county had at least one opioid treatment program and to estimate Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA)-waived provider capacity (qualified clinicians who can prescribe buprenorphine in office-based settings for opioid use disorder treatment) by county.** 

Differences in age-adjusted death rates from 2019 to 2020 were considered statistically significant if CIs did not overlap; a gamma distribution was used if <100 deaths occurred in either year.†† Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§§ 

Results 
From 2019 to 2020, overall drug overdose death rates increased in 25 states and DC; the largest increases occurred among certain racial/ethnic minority populations. Relative rate increases were highest among Black (44%) and AI/AN persons (39%) (Table 1). Among White persons, the rate increased by 22%. Within racial/ethnic groups, overdose death rates also varied by age. Black persons aged 15–24 years experienced the largest relative rate increase from 2019 to 2020 (86%). Among AI/AN persons, the highest relative rate increase occurred among those aged 25–44 years (49%). Among White persons, those aged 15–24 years experienced the largest relative rate increase (34%). 

When stratified by sex and age group, higher overdose death rates occurred among older Black males, with the highest rate in 2020 among those aged 45–64 years (124.9) (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118656). In addition, rates among Black males aged ≥65 years were nearly six times as high as those among White males of the same age in 2019 (35.7 versus 6.2), increasing to nearly seven times as high in 2020 (52.6 versus 7.7). Among AI/AN males, those aged 25–44 years experienced the highest rates in 2019 (67.5) and 2020 (87.2), similar to rates among White males in this age group (2019 = 72.7; 2020 = 87.0). Among Hispanic males, those aged 25–44 years had the highest rates in 2019 (47.6) and 2020 (57.3). The rate for Hispanic males aged 15–24 years increased 47% from 12.9 in 2019 to 18.9 in 2020. 

Among females, the largest rate disparities between AI/AN and White decedents were observed among those aged 25–44 years, with the disparity increasing nearly 57% from 2019 to 2020 (2019 rate ratio = 1.06; 2020 rate ratio = 1.66). AI/AN females aged 25–44 years also had the largest relative increase in overdose death rate from 2019 to 2020 (88%). 

A documented history of substance use was commonly reported for most decedents, with the highest proportion among White (78.3%), AI/AN (77.4%), and Hispanic (74.8%) decedents (Table 2). However, the proportion of decedents with documented evidence of previous substance use treatment was low overall, with the lowest proportions among Black (8.3%), Hispanic (10.2%), and AI/AN (10.7%) decedents. Evidence of injection drug use was most prevalent among White (28.0%) and AI/AN (22.9%) decedents. Evidence of naloxone administration was highest among AI/AN (21.5%) decedents and lowest among A/PI (16.4%) decedents but was low in all groups. 

In 2020, overdose death rates increased with increasing county-level income inequality ratios (the ratio of household income at the 80th percentile to income at the 20th percentile) across most racial/ethnic groups, but Black and Hispanic persons were disproportionally affected (Figure 1). Among Black persons, the overdose rate for counties with the highest income inequality (46.5) was more than twice that of counties with the lowest income inequality (19.3). In counties with the lowest income inequality, the rate was highest among AI/AN persons (35.2); in counties with the highest income inequality, the rate was highest among Black persons (46.5). Among Hispanic persons, the overdose rate in counties with the highest income inequality (28.1) was more than twice that of counties with the lowest income inequality (11.4). 

Drug overdose death rates were higher in counties with a higher potential capacity for treatment of mental health conditions (based on mental health provider availability), and this varied by race and ethnicity. Among Black persons, the drug overdose rate during 2020 in areas with the highest mental health provider availability (46.7) was more than 2.5 times as high as the rate in areas with the lowest rate of providers (17.2) (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118654). 

In 2020, the rates of opioid-involved deaths among Black and AI/AN persons in counties with at least one opioid treatment program were more than twice those in counties without opioid treatment programs (Black = 34.3 versus 16.6; AI/AN = 33.4 versus 16.2) (Supplementary Figure 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118655). In addition, the opioid-involved death rate among Black persons in counties with higher potential buprenorphine capacity from DATA-waived providers (35.4) was nearly triple that in counties with low potential capacity (12.3). Among counties with higher potential treatment capacity, overdose death rates increased 49% among Black persons from 2019 (23.7) to 2020 (35.4) and 55% among AI/AN persons (from 20.7 to 32.1) compared with 19% among White persons (from 24.0 to 28.6) (Figure 2).","This study highlights five critical findings on health disparities and inequities related to drug overdose deaths in the United States. First, from 2019 to 2020, disproportionate increases occurred among Black (44%) and AI/AN (39%) persons compared with those among White persons (22%). Among demographic subgroups, the rate among Black males aged ≥65 years increased to nearly seven times that of White males of the same age, and the rate among AI/AN females aged 25–44 years increased to nearly twice that of White females of the same age in 2020. Second, drug overdose death rates increased with increasing county-level income inequality, particularly among Black persons, among whom the overdose death rate was more than twice as high in areas with the highest income inequality as in areas with the lowest income inequality. Third, evidence of previous substance use treatment was lowest among Black decedents and approximately one half that of White decedents. Fourth, overdose death rates were highest in counties with higher potential substance use treatment capacity and mental health providers, and rates were more pronounced among Black and AI/AN persons than among White persons, likely associated with long-standing inequities in access to mental health and substance use care, including medications for opioid use disorder. Finally, evidence of naloxone administration was highest among AI/AN (21.5%) decedents and lowest among A/PI (16.4%) decedents but was low in all groups. These findings can help guide the implementation of equitable overdose prevention and response efforts. 

Prioritizing prevention and substance use disorder treatment for persons in areas with higher economic inequities is particularly important for certain groups. Higher drug use has been reported in areas with more economic distress, which increases the risk for fatal overdose (12). Further, impacts of income inequality (e.g., housing instability, transportation access, and insurance status), long-standing mistrust in the health care system, stigma, and bias contribute to treatment access barriers (12–14). In this analysis, Black decedents were the least likely racial or ethnic group to have evidence of substance use treatment, and 2020 overdose rates were highest among Black and AI/AN persons in areas with high treatment provider availability. Although high-prevalence areas might have a greater proportion of treatment services, this higher potential treatment capacity might not reflect treatment services that are accessible to community members, especially in counties that cover large geographic areas. The clustering of providers in denser population centers could result in transportation barriers for persons residing in less populated areas of the county.¶¶ Structural and policy-level interventions are essential to address these access barriers. These include expanding linkage to and retention in care, equitable access to treatment (e.g., medication for opioid use disorder) and behavioral health interventions, and harm reduction services (e.g., naloxone, comprehensive syringe services programs, and fentanyl test strips). 

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted long-neglected disparities in access to and provision of health care among AI/AN, Black, and Hispanic persons (11). The findings in this report underscore the increasing impact of the escalating overdose crisis on these populations. More stigmatization, criminalization, and lack of access to evidence-based treatments among racial/ethnic minority groups with substance use disorders have been well-documented (15). These barriers might further elucidate the disparities observed in reported history of substance use treatment and overdose death rates by income inequality and mental health provider availability among Black and AI/AN persons. For example, Black persons have more limited access to buprenorphine treatment than do White persons, and in AI/AN communities underfunding of tribal clinics has affected the availability of mental health treatment (9,14). In addition, polysubstance use and the increasing proliferation of IMFs in the drug supply have exacerbated the surge in overdose deaths (5). 

Prevention efforts must rapidly incorporate existing, evidence-based, culturally responsive interventions that address polysubstance use and social determinants of health to reduce inequities around prevention, treatment, and harm reduction. Integration of evidence-based substance use disorder treatment with culturally tailored traditional practices, spirituality, and religion might improve treatment acceptance among Black and AI/AN populations (16,17,18). Culturally specific awareness campaigns, employment in nontraditional and community settings, and trusted community prevention messengers to assist with linkages to treatment and harm reduction services could reduce stigma and mistrust as well as improve access and provision of care (18,19). In addition, expanding the current evidence base to address upstream drivers of inequity and implementing primary prevention efforts that focus on adverse childhood experiences that predispose persons to risk for substance use and substance use disorder as well as implementing trauma-informed care and services are critical.*** 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, analyses were limited to 26 jurisdictions reporting data to SUDORS, do not include all overdose deaths in the United States, and might not be generalizable. Second, overdose circumstance data are limited to information provided in investigative reports; therefore, overdose risk factors might be underestimated. Third, potential race and ethnicity misclassification might underestimate rates for certain populations, primarily Hispanic, AI/AN, and A/PI persons.††† Finally, because of low counts, rates for multiracial groups were not included in analyses. 

Provisional estimates indicate continued increases in drug overdose deaths in 2021 (20). Health disparities and inequities are likely exacerbating these increases, particularly among racial/ethnic minority groups. Drug overdoses are preventable, and rapidly scaling up multisectoral, culturally responsive prevention efforts across federal, state, local, and tribal entities that place equity as a central tenet to address the escalating overdose crisis is urgently needed.

Identifying and linking children living with HIV to treatment is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. 

What is added by this report? 

During the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV testing and case identification among children and adolescents aged 1–14 years in 22 PEPFAR-supported countries decreased by 40.1% and 29.4%, respectively. Although outpatient testing decreased (21%), testing increased for other strategies, including mobile (38%), facility-based index (8%), and malnutrition (7%), suggesting these strategies can mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric case identification. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

HIV testing programs can use programmatic, surveillance, and financial data to determine the optimal mix of testing strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During 2020, an estimated 150,000 persons aged 0–14 years acquired HIV globally (1). Case identification is the first step to ensure children living with HIV are linked to life-saving treatment, achieve viral suppression, and live long, healthy lives. Successful interventions to optimize pediatric HIV testing during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed to sustain progress toward achieving Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 95–95–95 targets.* Changes in HIV testing and diagnoses among persons aged 1–14 years (children) were assessed in 22 U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported countries during October 1, 2019–September 30, 2020. This period corresponds to the two fiscal quarters before the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., Q1 and Q2) and the two quarters after the pandemic began (i.e., Q3 and Q4). Testing was disaggregated by age group, testing strategy, and fiscal year quarter. During October 2019–September 2020, PEPFAR supported 4,312,343 HIV tests and identified 74,658 children living with HIV (CLHIV). The number of HIV tests performed was similar during Q1 and Q2, decreased 40.1% from Q2 to Q3, and increased 19.7% from Q3 to Q4. The number of HIV cases identified among children aged 1–14 years (cases identified) increased 7.4% from Q1 to Q2, decreased 29.4% from Q2 to Q3, and increased 3.3% from Q3 to Q4. Although testing in outpatient departments decreased 21% from Q1 to Q4, testing from other strategies increased during the same period, including mobile testing by 38%, facility-based index testing (offering an HIV test to partners and biological children of persons living with HIV) by 8%, and testing children with signs or symptoms of malnutrition within health facilities by 7%. In addition, most tests (61.3%) and cases identified (60.9%) were among children aged 5–14 years (school-aged children), highlighting the need to continue offering HIV testing to older children. These findings provide important information on the most effective strategies for identifying CLHIV during the COVID-19 pandemic. HIV testing programs should continue to use programmatic, surveillance, and financial data at both national and subnational levels to determine the optimal mix of testing strategies to minimize disruptions in pediatric case identification during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Monitoring, evaluation, and reporting indicators† from 22 of 50 PEPFAR-supported countries were analyzed to assess changes in the number of HIV tests conducted and the number of cases identified among children during the two fiscal quarters before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2019–March 2020) and the two fiscal quarters after the pandemic began (April–September 2020). These 22 countries were selected because they account for >80% of CLHIV not receiving HIV treatment globally. Percent positivity was calculated by dividing the number of positive test results by the total number of tests reported. HIV test outcomes are reported overall, and by country, age group, testing strategy, and fiscal year quarter. Testing strategies include provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) in outpatient departments, tuberculosis clinics, malnutrition services, well-child clinics (for infants and children aged <5 years), and inpatient wards; index testing in facility and community settings; voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) initiated by clients; and mobile testing in the community. This protocol was reviewed in accordance with CDC human research protection procedures, determined to be a non-research public health program activity, and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.§ 

Of the 4,312,343 HIV tests conducted among children in the 22 countries, approximately one quarter (22.6%) occurred in South Africa. Among the 74,658 cases identified (representing an overall 1.7% positivity rate), approximately one half (54.7%) were in Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania, with Mozambique identifying the most cases (12,367; 16.6%) (Table 1). The majority of tests conducted (61.3%) and of cases identified (60.9%) were among school-aged children (Table 1). Percent positivity was highest among children aged 5–9 years (2.1%) followed by those aged 1–4 (1.8%) and 10–14 (1.5%) years. 

The number of HIV tests conducted among children decreased 40.1% from Q2 to Q3 across all 22 countries at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic but increased 19.7% from Q3 to Q4 as programs began making shifts in their HIV testing strategies. Similarly, the number of cases identified decreased 29.4% from Q2 to Q3 but increased 3.3% from Q3 to Q4. Seventeen of the 22 countries reported that the number of cases identified increased from Q3 to Q4. By Q4, case identification had surpassed pre–COVID-19 levels in six countries, (Q4:Q1 ratio ≥1.0), returned to pre–COVID-19 levels in three countries (Q4:Q1 ratio >0.95–<1.0), and remained below pre–COVID-19 levels in 13 countries (Q4:Q1 ratio <0.95) (Table 2). 

Approximately one half (47.9%) of HIV tests were conducted in outpatient department settings, followed by facility-based index testing (12.1%), well-child clinics (8.1%), and mobile testing (5.4%). PITC in outpatient departments identified the largest number of cases (24,812; 33.2%), followed by facility-based index testing (24,372; 32.6%), community-based index testing (5,922; 7.9%), and VCT (5,034; 6.7%). Similarly, the percent positivity was highest for PITC in tuberculosis clinics (5.4%), followed by facility-based index testing (4.6%), community-based index testing (3.6%), and VCT (2.6%). Facility and community-based index testing, combined, identified the most cases across the four quarters (40.5%; positivity rate = 4.4%), despite only representing 18.3% of all testing. 

By Q4, the number of tests conducted returned to pre–COVID-19 levels (Q4:Q1 ratio >0.95) for three strategies: mobile testing, facility-based index testing, and PITC among malnourished children (Table 3). However, the number of tests conducted was <75% of pre–COVID-19 levels in Q4 for PITC in inpatient wards and well-child clinics, VCT, and index testing in community settings. The number of cases identified decreased from Q2 to Q3 across all strategies except inpatient wards, where the number increased by 28.8% and the percentage of HIV-positive test results nearly doubled from 1.2% to 2.2%. By Q4, case identification only reached pre–COVID-19 levels for facility-based index testing and PITC among malnourished children. 

","Findings from this report suggest progress toward reaching the UNAIDS 95–95–95 targets for CLHIV were negatively affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially during April–June 2020. Although the number of HIV tests conducted and cases identified increased from Q3 to Q4, the overall number of children diagnosed with HIV during Q4 remained below pre–COVID-19 levels. Although more resource intensive (2), index testing remains a priority for identifying children before they develop advanced disease, and during the COVID-19 pandemic when children and caregivers are less likely to seek outpatient services (3). Prioritizing the identification and testing of the biological children of key populations (i.e., persons who engage in sex work, men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs, persons who identify as transgender, and persons who are incarcerated in prisons and other closed settings) living with HIV is also critical given their increased risk and vulnerabilities (4). 

Although community index testing and mobile testing did not identify as many cases as did PITC, they also remain important strategies to identify children unable to access health care (5), and to limit potential exposures at health care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a similar recent analysis of 16 countries, those countries that maintained or increased community-based testing, including index testing, were able to mitigate declines in the number of cases identified during the COVID-19 pandemic (5). In the current analysis, the number of tests conducted and cases identified in community-based index testing during Q4 did not reach pre–COVID-19 levels, although this strategy did have a relatively high percent positivity in Q4. Community-based testing strategies are often more expensive than facility-based approaches (6). Therefore, each country program will have to determine the cost-benefit ratio of different testing strategies using national and subnational data to guide decisions on which strategies to implement for pediatric case finding. Orphans and vulnerable children programs, which are integral to community-based care for CLHIV, can also provide support to facilitate HIV testing (7). Programs might consider accelerating policies allowing the distribution of oral self-test kits to caregivers to screen their biological children aged ≥2 years for HIV to reduce barriers to HIV testing, decrease visits to health care facilities, and close gaps in elicitation and testing of biological contacts (8). 

Children infected through perinatal transmission might be seen at health care facilities (e.g., tuberculosis clinics, malnutrition clinics, and inpatient wards) with advanced disease if they are not diagnosed through other testing strategies. In this analysis, the percent positivity was highest for PITC in tuberculosis clinics; testing in inpatient wards was the only strategy that had an increase in cases identified during the first quarter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Universal testing at these entry points is therefore crucial, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when children might seek care with more advanced disease. In addition, most tests conducted (61.3%) and cases identified (60.9%) were among school-aged children. This finding highlights the ongoing need for both early infant diagnosis to identify and link children to treatment at an earlier age and HIV testing services among older children because studies indicate children infected during breastfeeding can survive into adolescence even without treatment (9). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, although countries follow PEPFAR monitoring and reporting guidance, data quality and reporting by testing strategy vary across countries. This caveat is particularly true for community-based testing in which contacts of known persons living with HIV might not always be accurately reflected under index testing. Second, PEPFAR indicators monitor the number of tests conducted, not the number of persons tested. Thus, the number of tests conducted and HIV-positive test results returned might be higher than the number of persons who received testing. Third, the impacts, restrictions, and adaptations to the COVID-19 pandemic varied across countries. This analysis cannot fully account for the impact of these variations on the results presented. Further qualitative assessments might provide a more in-depth understanding of how COVID-19 affected the provision and uptake of HIV testing across multiple waves of the pandemic. Finally, some countries did not use all the testing strategies included in this analysis. 

Case identification is the first step to ensure CLHIV are linked to life-saving treatment, achieve viral suppression, and live long, healthy lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many PEPFAR-supported countries experienced disruptions in case identification among CLHIV. Six countries (Angola, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, and Haiti), however, were able to exceed pre–COVID-19 case identification levels, using a combination of high yield strategies, including facility index testing, mobile testing, and testing children with signs or symptoms of malnutrition. These findings provide important information for countries and programs on the most effective strategies for identifying CLHIV during the COVID-19 pandemic. HIV testing programs should continue to use programmatic, surveillance, and financial data at both national and subnational levels to determine the optimal mix of testing strategies to minimize disruptions in pediatric case identification during the COVID-19 pandemic surges and other public health crises.","Corresponding author: Amy Medley, igm8@cdc.gov, 404-718-8601.","Suggested citation for this article: Traub AM, Medley A, Gross J, et al.

Additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine are recommended for immunocompromised persons, and 518,113 fourth doses were presumed administered to this population during January–March, 2022. 

What is added by this report? 

Among presumed immunocompromised persons aged ≥12 years, local and systemic reactions were less frequently reported to v-safe after mRNA booster (dose 4) than after primary series dose 3. Only 17 serious adverse events were reported to VAERS. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Serious adverse events after mRNA booster (dose 4) are rare. Immunocompromised persons aged ≥12 years should receive a first booster ≥3 months after a 3-dose primary COVID-19 vaccination series and a second booster ≥4 months after the first booster.

Persons with moderate to severe immunocompromising conditions are at risk for severe COVID-19, and their immune response to COVID-19 vaccination might not be as robust as the response in persons who are not immunocompromised* (1). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that immunocompromised persons aged ≥12 years complete a 3-dose primary mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series followed by a first booster dose (dose 4) ≥3 months after dose 3 and a second booster dose (dose 5) ≥4 months after dose 4.† To characterize the safety of first booster doses among immunocompromised persons aged ≥12 years during January 12, 2022–March 28, 2022, CDC reviewed adverse events and health impact assessments reported to v-safe and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during the week after receipt of an mRNA COVID-19 first booster dose. V-safe is a voluntary smartphone-based safety surveillance system for adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination. VAERS is a passive surveillance system for all vaccine-associated adverse events co-managed by CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A fourth mRNA dose reported to v-safe or VAERS during January 12, 2022–March 28, 2022, was presumed to be an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose administered to an immunocompromised person because no other population was authorized to receive a fourth dose during that period (2,3). In the United States, during January 12, 2022–March 28, 2022, approximately 518,113 persons aged ≥12 years received a fourth dose. Among 4,015 v-safe registrants who received a fourth dose, local and systemic reactions were less frequently reported than were those following dose 3 of their primary series. VAERS received 145 reports after fourth doses; 128 (88.3%) were nonserious and 17 (11.7%) were serious. Health care providers, immunocompromised persons, and parents of immunocompromised children should be aware that local and systemic reactions are expected after a first booster mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, serious adverse events are rare, and safety findings were consistent with those previously described among nonimmunocompromised persons (4,5). 

V-safe is a voluntary, smartphone–based U.S. active safety surveillance system established by CDC to monitor adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination (https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/). The v-safe platform allows registrants to report receipt of a COVID-19 booster dose; new registrants enter information about all doses received. Coincident with authorization for a booster dose in persons with moderate-to-severe immunocompromising conditions, v-safe was updated to allow registrants to enter information about a fourth dose. Registrants aged ≤15 years are enrolled by a parent or guardian. Health surveys sent daily during the first week after administration of each dose include questions about local injection site and systemic reactions and health impacts.§ CDC’s v-safe call center contacts registrants who indicate that medical care was sought after vaccination and encourages completion of a VAERS report, if indicated. 

VAERS is a U.S. national passive safety surveillance system that monitors adverse events after vaccination and is managed by CDC and FDA (6). VAERS accepts reports from health care providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the general public.¶ VAERS reports of hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death are classified as serious.** VAERS staff members assign Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms to the findings included in VAERS reports.†† Serious reports to VAERS were reviewed by CDC and FDA physicians to form a consensus clinical impression. For reports of death, death certificates and autopsy reports are requested and reviewed by CDC physicians to form an impression about cause of death. Reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, rare adverse events that have been associated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, were identified by searching for selected MedDRA preferred terms; CDC staff members attempted to collect information about clinical course and determined whether the case definition was met.§§ 

In v-safe, a fourth mRNA dose administered ≥3 months after dose 3 to a registrant aged ≥12 years during January 12, 2022–March 28, 2022 (data processed April 17, 2022) was presumed to be an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose administered to an immunocompromised person; this cutoff date was chosen to reduce overlap with fourth doses administered as a second booster to adults aged ≥50 years, which was recommended on March 29, 2022. The odds of reporting an adverse reaction or health impact after a fourth versus a third dose were compared using a multivariable generalized estimated equations model that accounted for demographic variables, vaccine manufacturer, and repeated measures; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. VAERS adverse event reports after a fourth dose among immunocompromised persons were described by seriousness classification (serious versus nonserious), demographic characteristics, and MedDRA preferred terms; a report of a fourth mRNA dose administered to a person aged ≥12 years during January 12, 2022–March 28, 2022 (data processed April 17, 2022) that did not include MedDRA preferred terms for vaccine error was presumed to be an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose administered to an immunocompromised person. SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used to conduct all analyses. These surveillance activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶¶ 

Review of v-safe Data 
Overall, 4,015 v-safe registrants reported receiving a fourth dose during January 12, 2022–March 28, 2022, and were presumed to be immunocompromised persons receiving a booster dose; 2,194 persons (54.6%) received mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and 1,821 (45.4%) BNT162b2 (Pfizer- BioNTech) vaccine. The median registrant age was 62 years (range = 12–94 years); 2,489 (62.0%) were female. In the week after vaccination, local injection site reactions and sys­temic reactions were reported by 1,605 (73.2%) and 1,470 (67.0%) Moderna vaccine recipients, respectively, and by 1,209 (66.4%) and 1,155 (63.4%) Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients, respectively (Table 1). The most frequently reported adverse reactions after dose 4 of either vaccine were injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia. Local injection site reactions were less frequently reported after dose 4 (70.1%) than after dose 3 (81.7%) (p<0.001); systemic reactions also were less frequently reported after dose 4 (65.4%) than after dose 3 (76.8%) (p<0.001) (Figure). 

In the week after dose 4 vaccination, 24.7% of Moderna vaccine recipients and 21.7% of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine recipients reported they were unable to complete their daily activities, and approximately 9% of registrants reported they were unable to attend work or school (Table 1). Fewer than 2% of registrants reported receipt of medical care during the week after dose 4; most who did require care received it through a telehealth appointment. Two registrants reported receiving care at a hospital during the week after dose 4 vaccination. The v-safe call center contacted both these registrants; one completed a VAERS report, and the other indicated the report was accidental or unrelated to vaccination. Inability to work or attend school was less frequently reported after dose 4 (9.2%) than after dose 3 (13.8%) (p<0.001); inability to perform daily activities was less frequently reported after dose 4 (23.4%) than after dose 3 (34.5%) (p<0.001) (Figure). Receipt of medical care was rarely and similarly reported after receipt of either dose 4 (1.8%) or dose 3 (1.9%) (p = 0.70). 

Review of VAERS Data 
VAERS received 421 reports from persons who received a fourth dose during January 12–March 28, 2022; 276 (65.6%) of these reports listed a vaccine error. Among reports noting a vaccine error, 225 (81.5%) indicated that no adverse health event occurred. 

The remaining 145 (34.4%) reports were presumed to be for immunocompromised persons who received a fourth dose. Among these, 105 (72.4%) reports were for events among females, and the median age was 62 years. Most reports were for nonserious events (128; 88.3%) (Table 2); the nonserious events most commonly reported included headache (30; 23.4%), fatigue (26; 20.3%), and pain (22; 17.2%). One nonserious, preliminary report of myocarditis remains under review. There were 17 (11.7%) reports of serious adverse events. One report of death was received from a manufacturer regarding a patient with pulmonary fibrosis who developed respiratory failure; at the time of publication, no further information was available, and follow-up continues. 

","This report presents safety findings from v-safe and VAERS after receipt of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses during a period when a fourth mRNA dose was recommended only for persons with immunocompromising conditions. Reports to v-safe and VAERS after mRNA booster vaccination among persons who received a fourth dose were similar to previous reports that assessed safety data after dose 3 mRNA booster vaccination among nonimmunocompromised persons (4,5). 

Local and systemic reactions and health impacts were less frequently reported to v-safe after receipt of dose 4 than after dose 3 of the primary series among persons with presumed immunocompromise. Similarly, in previous analyses, among all v-safe registrants aged ≥18 years who received a homologous mRNA booster, systemic reactions were less frequent after dose 3 vaccination than after dose 2 (5). Among adolescents aged 12–17 years who received a homologous Pfizer-BioNTech third dose, reactions were reported to v-safe with equal or slightly higher frequency after receipt of that booster dose than after dose 2 (4). 

Most reports to VAERS related to booster doses among persons with presumed immunocompromise were nonserious; the most common adverse events reported were similar to those reported by persons aged ≥18 years after an mRNA booster (5). Serious reports to VAERS among persons with presumed immunocompromise included a range of adverse events; no unusual or unexpected reporting patterns were detected. 

The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, v-safe is a voluntary program; therefore, data might not be representative of the vaccinated U.S. population. Second, it is possible that vaccinees who experience an adverse event could be more likely to respond to v-safe surveys and the reported prevalence of adverse events might overestimate the actual prevalence. Third, as a passive surveillance system, VAERS is subject to reporting biases and underreporting, especially of nonserious events (6). Fourth, v-safe does not collect information on immunocompromise, and VAERS does not ask about immunocompromising health conditions; therefore, it is not possible to confirm that vaccine recipients included in this analysis were immunocompromised. Fifth, this report did not examine pattern of reporting by heterologous and homologous vaccination. Finally, a report to v-safe or VAERS alone cannot be used to assess causality. 

ACIP recommends that moderately or severely immunocompromised persons aged ≥12 years receive a first booster dose ≥3 months after completion of a 3-dose primary COVID-19 vaccination series and a second booster dose ≥4 months after the first booster. Preliminary safety findings for booster doses among persons with presumed immunocompromise are similar to those among nonimmunocompromised persons; reactions are reported less frequently after booster vaccination than after the last dose of a primary series. It is important that health care providers, immunocompromised persons, and parents of immunocompromised children be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after a booster dose, and that serious adverse events are rare. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates as needed to guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations.","Corresponding author: Anne M.

The Laboratory Response Network (LRN) includes U.S. laboratories validated to perform the non-variola Orthopoxvirus (NVO) assay. 

What is added by this report? 

During May 17–June 30, 2022, LRN laboratories tested 2,009 specimens from patients with suspected monkeypox. Among these, 730 (36%) specimens from 395 patients were positive for NVO. Specimens from 159 persons with NVO-positive results were confirmed by CDC to be monkeypox; confirmatory testing is pending for 236. LRN laboratories have increased testing capacity from 8,000 per week in June because of NVO assay updates. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

LRN laboratories’ rapid results enable prompt patient treatment and prevention of further transmission. Expansion of testing to five large national laboratories will increase ease of access to testing.

As part of public health preparedness for infectious disease threats, CDC collaborates with other U.S. public health officials to ensure that the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) has diagnostic tools to detect Orthopoxviruses, the genus that includes Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. LRN is a network of state and local public health, federal, U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), veterinary, food, and environmental testing laboratories. CDC developed, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted 510(k) clearance* for the Non-variola Orthopoxvirus Real-time PCR Primer and Probe Set (non-variola Orthopoxvirus [NVO] assay), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic test to detect NVO. On May 17, 2022, CDC was contacted by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) regarding a suspected case of monkeypox, a disease caused by the Orthopoxvirus Monkeypox virus. Specimens were collected and tested by the Massachusetts DPH public health laboratory with LRN testing capability using the NVO assay. Nationwide, 68 LRN laboratories had capacity to test approximately 8,000 NVO tests per week during June. During May 17–June 30, LRN laboratories tested 2,009 specimens from suspected monkeypox cases. Among those, 730 (36.3%) specimens from 395 patients were positive for NVO. NVO-positive specimens from 159 persons were confirmed by CDC to be monkeypox; final characterization is pending for 236. Prompt identification of persons with infection allowed rapid response to the outbreak, including isolation and treatment of patients, administration of vaccines, and other public health action. To further facilitate access to testing and increase convenience for providers and patients by using existing provider-laboratory relationships, CDC and LRN are supporting five large commercial laboratories with a national footprint (Aegis Science, LabCorp, Mayo Clinic Laboratories, Quest Diagnostics, and Sonic Healthcare) to establish NVO testing capacity of 10,000 specimens per week per laboratory. On July 6, 2022, the first commercial laboratory began accepting specimens for NVO testing based on clinician orders. 

LRN was established in 1999† as a partnership among CDC, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories, with the goal of ensuring a laboratory infrastructure across the United States that can respond quickly and effectively to biothreats, chemical threats, and emerging infectious diseases (1). LRN provides the framework to rapidly distribute laboratory diagnostic tests, standardized reagents, and standard operating procedures, and to train laboratory personnel, report laboratory test results, and provide critical communication during routine and emergency responses. LRN includes approximately 110 U.S. laboratories, primarily state and local public health and DOD laboratories, as well as veterinary, food, and environmental testing laboratories. LRN laboratories are required to participate in proficiency testing exercises to ensure competency for laboratory test methods distributed to the network. 

To effectively respond to a potential Orthopoxvirus outbreak, CDC subject matter experts worked with LRN to design, develop, and validate an assay to detect NVOs, such as Vaccinia, Cowpox, Monkeypox, and Ectromelia viruses, if suspected cases were identified. The NVO assay first received 510(k) clearance by FDA in 2005 and was cleared again in 2018 to update the labeling and use of reagents. The NVO assay does not differentiate Monkeypox virus from other Orthopoxviruses. NVOs are not endemic in the United States; however, the NVO assay has been used to detect cases of Vaccinia virus infection associated with vaccination and two imported cases of monkeypox from travelers in 2021 (2). 

CDC recommends that for each patient, clinicians collect two specimens, each from multiple lesions, preferably from different locations on the body and from lesions with differing appearances (3). The CDC Monkeypox virus testing algorithm includes NVO testing, and if results are positive for Orthopoxvirus, further characterization testing at CDC (4). A subset of specimens was characterized at CDC by a Monkeypox virus specific real-time PCR assay and genetic sequencing.§ The median LRN laboratory testing turnaround time was calculated from the time of specimen receipt by LRN testing laboratories to arrival of NVO test results at CDC. Testing capacity was estimated and reported by LRN laboratories. This report describes NVO testing by LRN during May 17–June 30, 2022. This investigation was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶ 

As of June 10, 68 U.S. LRN laboratories, located in 47 states and the District of Columbia, had implemented the NVO assay updated in 2018 and tested specimens from patients with probable monkeypox cases. These laboratories reported an estimated total testing capacity of 8,000 specimens per week. LRN laboratories reported that capacity of NVO testing laboratories was limited by reagent availability and the requirement for manual DNA extraction. To increase testing throughput and build capacity, the NVO assay was rapidly updated to include additional controls, automated extraction, and real-time PCR instrumentation in collaboration with FDA; the updated assay received 510(k) clearance on June 10, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, 78 LRN laboratories had implemented the NVO assay and have reported a total testing capacity of 24,000 specimens per week with implementation of substantial operational changes such as adding extra shifts, reassigning personnel, and shifting testing priorities based on laboratory emergency response plans. 

During May 17–June 30, a total of 2,009 specimens were tested in LRN laboratories (Table); 730 (36.3%) specimens from 395 persons across 31 jurisdictions (including 29 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico) were confirmed positive for Orthopoxvirus using the NVO assay. One positive specimen from each patient (159) was sent to CDC and further characterized as Monkeypox virus belonging to the West African clade; as of June 30, 236 confirmed Orthopoxvirus cases were pending characterization. The median LRN laboratory testing turnaround time was 30.7 hours for all results (Table). 

Although LRN laboratories provide initial recognition and detection of emerging infectious diseases, rapid expansion of nationwide testing capacity was indicated for this outbreak. Therefore, CDC obtained 510(k) clearance from FDA on June 23 to enable CDC to provide the NVO assay to five large commercial laboratories under a licensing agreement that included CDC training and test verification before the start of testing. This expansion of testing provides additional test capacity and electronic laboratory reporting to public health authorities, makes testing more accessible, and streamlines diagnostic testing for multiple, possible infections. When fully operational, these five national commercial laboratories are anticipated to increase weekly testing capacity nationwide by approximately 10,000 specimens per laboratory.","CDC and LRN have collaborated with public health partners to prepare for Orthopoxvirus outbreaks, enabling rapid public health response through the development and expansion of testing capacity and medical countermeasures to prevent the spread of disease. Laboratory preparedness efforts included NVO test validation, FDA 510(k) clearance, distribution, and verification of diagnostic tests to detect NVO. This response highlights the importance of preparedness against emerging infectious diseases and the need to further strengthen and expand LRN to include other partners to enhance testing capability and increase surge testing capacity. 

Because monkeypox disease has been rare in the United States, CDC’s NVO assay is the only FDA 510(k)–cleared assay to detect NVO; at the onset of this outbreak, use of the assay was limited to LRN laboratories. The 510(k) clearance facilitated rapid testing and detection of a rare, high-risk, and emerging pathogen by LRN laboratories by maintaining competency and biosafety practices, results reporting, and collaborating with public health authorities, all essential to the initial national response. 

CDC recommends that U.S. health care providers be alert for patients who have rash illnesses consistent with monkeypox (5) and include NVO testing as part of their clinical workup. Clinicians who suspect a case of monkeypox can contact their local or state health department** for specimen submission guidance. A rapid turnaround time for test results is critical to quickly initiate public health action to better control the spread of monkeypox disease. Treatment is the same for all NVO infections; thus, a positive test result for an Orthopoxvirus using the NVO assay is immediately actionable, leading to the use of antiorthopoxviral treatment, if warranted, and allowing public health authorities to initiate isolation, contact tracing, monitoring, investigation, and postexposure prophylaxis of exposed contacts (5). In addition, if monkeypox is suspected based on clinical signs and symptoms, clinicians can initiate treatment, advise patients to isolate while awaiting test results, and take measures to prevent further transmission, like limiting close contact with others or avoiding the sharing of potential contaminated items. Tecovirimat (TPOXX) can also be prescribed as treatment for people with monkeypox, and two vaccines, JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 (6) can be provided to close contacts as postexposure prophylaxis. By the end of June 2022, <10% of the available nationwide LRN NVO testing capacity had been used. Despite the high capacity, some clinicians and patients reported challenges navigating public health testing procedures, including acquiring public health approvals for testing. Expansion to five commercial laboratories starting the week of July 5 should make testing more accessible, increase convenience for providers and patients by both using existing provider-laboratory relationships and eliminating the need for prior public health approval, and further augment national capacity. Expanded testing access via both LRN and commercial laboratories provides the opportunity to identify all cases of Orthopoxvirus to enhance monitoring and response to the outbreak.","Corresponding author: Tricia A.

LLCHD initiated an investigation in collaboration with NDHHS to identify the source of the outbreak and develop recommendations. The investigation linked consumption of mechanically separated chicken to illness. Mechanically separated chicken, which is produced at chicken processing facilities by separating edible chicken from bone and cartilage under pressure, is frequently purchased for use in institutions, such as prisons, jails, and correctional facilities because of its affordability (1,2). 

Staff members at facility A reported approximately 100 inmates experienced gastrointestinal symptoms during a period of a few days; no staff member reported illness. LLCHD conducted open-ended interviews with ill inmates. Because the facility was experiencing a concurrent outbreak of COVID-19, and access to inmates for interviews was limited, it is likely that additional cases existed among noninterviewed and untested inmates beyond the total cases identified in the investigation. Inmates who were designated food handlers were prioritized for interviews because of transmission risk to others; untested inmates were able to seek care through facility A medical staff. A probable case was defined as the onset of diarrhea, stomach cramps, or vomiting during January 9–11, 2022, but without a positive stool culture, in an inmate at facility A; a confirmed case was defined as isolation of Salmonella serotype Enteritidis highly related to the outbreak strain (within three alleles) by core genome multilocus sequence typing in a clinical specimen. LLCHD conducted an environmental assessment on January 15, 2022. A list of food handlers, food menus for January, and temperature logs were requested. During the environmental assessment, a sample of raw, unopened mechanically separated chicken from a 50-lb intact box from the same shipment used to prepare a meal on January 8, 2022, was collected for testing. 

A total of 15 cases of S. Enteritidis infection were identified, including five confirmed and 10 probable cases. The median patient age was 39 years (range = 24–62 years); 93% were male and two patients were hospitalized. All 15 cases occurred in food workers, all of whom reported eating chili that had been prepared from the raw mechanically separated chicken product. 

S. Enteritidis that genetically matched the outbreak strain was isolated from the raw mechanically separated chicken sample. The Food Safety and Inspection Service agency of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was notified by NDHHS of the poultry product matching the outbreak. However, Salmonella spp. are not considered adulterants of raw poultry products because Salmonella is regularly present on poultry products, and safe standard cooking practices typically destroy Salmonella bacteria; therefore, no regulatory action was taken* (3). 

The environmental assessment identified potential food safety risks in both incomplete thawing and cooking processes for mechanically separated chicken. Qualitative interviews revealed that the mechanically separated chicken product was sometimes still frozen or partially frozen at the time of cooking; this process was also observed by LLCHD on a follow-up site visit. Cooking temperatures were not routinely monitored while food was being prepared, and LLCHD was unable to verify that the mechanically separated chicken product reached a safe internal cooking temperature before being served. 

LLCHD provided recommendations for prevention of foodborne outbreaks to facility A, which included policies for excluding ill workers from food preparation, increased thawing time for mechanically separated chicken under refrigeration, routine monitoring and recording of cooking temperatures, and adjustment of meals to smaller preparation volumes to mitigate food safety risks. LLCHD worked with facility management to implement new policies and procedures for food safety practices. 

This outbreak of S. Enteritidis was associated with mechanically separated chicken and substandard cooking processes. Mechanically separated chicken products routinely tested by USDA have indicated a higher prevalence of Salmonella spp. (82.9%) than ground chicken (39.0%) and other comminuted chicken products (41.7%) sampled and tested during June 1, 2013–December 31, 2014 (4). Mechanically separated chicken is typically used as an ingredient in other processed meat products, such as hot dogs, which can be thermally processed to ensure they are cooked to a safe internal temperature (1). Several previous state and multistate salmonellosis outbreaks have implicated mechanically separated chicken as the source of infection in correctional facilities† (1). Populations who are obligated to eat in certain locations and who have limited choice regarding what they eat are dependent on societal responsibility to ensure their health and the facility’s food safety procedures (5). Mitigating the risks of food handling and processing and cooking in vulnerable populations and institutions requires two key actions: 1) providing a less highly contaminated poultry product in the absence of contamination threshold regulatory requirements for poultry products and 2) implementing a preventive food safety management system to ensure thawing, cooking, and cooling processes meet food safety requirements.",N/A,"Corresponding author: Sadie J.

Immunocompromise is associated with increased risk for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Population-based descriptions of immunocompromised hospitalized patients and their outcomes are limited. 

What is added by this report? 

Immunocompromised patients accounted for 12.2% of all adult COVID-19 hospitalizations among 10 states and had increased odds of ICU admission and in-hospital death compared with nonimmunocompromised patients, irrespective of vaccination status. 

What are the implications for public health practice? 

Known multilayered prevention measures, including nonpharmaceutical interventions, up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination, and therapeutics, can prevent hospitalization and subsequent severe COVID-19 outcomes among immunocompromised persons.

Immunocompromised persons are at increased risk for severe COVID-19–related outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death (1). Data on adults aged ≥18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 10 U.S. states in the COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) were analyzed to assess associations between immunocompromise and ICU admission and in-hospital death during March 1, 2020–February 28, 2022. Associations of COVID-19 vaccination status with ICU admission and in-hospital death were also examined during March 1, 2021–February 28, 2022. During March 1, 2020–February 28, 2022, among a sample of 22,345 adults hospitalized for COVID-19, 12.2% were immunocompromised. Among unvaccinated patients, those with immunocompromise had higher odds of ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.08–1.49) and in-hospital death (aOR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.05–1.70) than did nonimmunocompromised patients. Among vaccinated patients,* those with immunocompromise had higher odds of ICU admission (aOR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.01–1.92) and in-hospital death (aOR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.28–2.75) than did nonimmunocompromised patients. During March 1, 2021–February 28, 2022, among nonimmunocompromised patients, patients who were vaccinated had lower odds of death (aOR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.39–0.86) than did unvaccinated patients; among immunocompromised patients, odds of death between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients did not differ. Immunocompromised persons need additional protection from COVID-19 and using multiple known COVID-19 prevention strategies,† including nonpharmaceutical interventions, up-to-date vaccination of immunocompromised persons and their close contacts,§ early testing, and COVID-19 prophylactic (Evusheld) and early antiviral treatment,¶ can help prevent hospitalization and subsequent severe COVID-19 outcomes among immunocompromised persons. 

COVID-NET is a CDC-funded collaboration for population-based surveillance of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated hospitalization in 99 U.S. counties in 14 states. A COVID-NET case is defined as a positive real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen test result for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) within 14 days before or during hospitalization in a person who lived in the surveillance catchment area. Medical chart abstraction and representative sampling methods have been described previously (2). Data collected on sampled adults hospitalized during March 1, 2020–February 28, 2022, across 10 participating states** were examined. Patients whose hospitalization was not likely related to COVID-19†† and those without a completed chart review were excluded. Immunocompromised patients were defined as those having one or more predefined immunocompromising conditions.§§ COVID-19 vaccination definitions for immunocompromised persons changed during the study period¶¶; in this analysis, a vaccinated patient was defined as one who had received both doses of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination series or 1 dose of a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine with or without additional or booster doses ≥14 days before their positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, per state immunization information system records. Vaccinated patients with additional or booster doses were not analyzed separately. Patients were considered unvaccinated if no COVID-19 vaccination was recorded before the positive test result; patients who were documented to have received only the first dose of a 2-dose series or their last vaccination series dose <14 days before receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result were excluded. 

Demographic and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients were assessed; Pearson’s chi-square tests were used to compare differences between immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised patients. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between immunocompromise and both ICU admission and in-hospital death among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients in separate models. Associations between each individual immunocompromising condition and death were assessed using multivariable analyses, adjusting only for age and sex to improve model convergence. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to assess the association between vaccination status and both ICU admission and in-hospital death among immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised patients in separate models, using data beginning March 1, 2021, when immunocompromised patients first reported receiving vaccine doses, through February 28, 2022. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, sex, site (entered as a fixed effect), SARS-CoV-2 variant–predominant period,*** and other factors with documented or potential association and a p-value <0.10 in bivariate analyses. Statistical analyses used SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) survey procedures to account for sampling weights, with statistical significance set at alpha = 0.05. This activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††† 

During March 1, 2020–February 28, 2022, a representative sample of 24,625 (11.0%, unweighted) of 223,069 COVID-NET cases had complete chart review, including 22,345§§§ (90.7%, unweighted) that met inclusion criteria. Among the 22,345 patients included, 12.2% were immunocompromised, including 11.1%, 10.9%, and 17.3% of patients hospitalized during the pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron variant–predominant periods, respectively. Overall, immunocompromised patients were more likely to be older and to be non-Hispanic White (Table 1). Compared with nonimmunocompromised patients, those with immunocompromise had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of all underlying medical conditions except diabetes and neurologic disease. 

Among unvaccinated patients, those who were immunocompromised had higher odds of ICU admission (aOR = 1.26) and death (aOR = 1.34) than did nonimmunocompromised patients¶¶¶ (Table 2). Similarly, among vaccinated patients, those who were immunocompromised also had higher odds of ICU admission (aOR = 1.40) and in-hospital death (aOR = 1.87) compared with nonimmunocompromised patients.**** Among patients with a specific immunocompromising condition compared with patients without that condition (irrespective of immunocompromise status), the odds of in-hospital death were higher for those with AIDS or low CD4+ count (aOR = 2.03), immunosuppressive therapy use (aOR = 1.65), multiple myeloma (aOR = 5.28), or solid organ transplant (aOR = 2.12) and lower for patients with immunoglobulin deficiency (aOR = 0.16) (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118606). 

Among immunocompromised patients, those who were vaccinated did not have statistically significantly different odds of ICU admission or in-hospital death†††† compared with unvaccinated patients (Table 3). Among nonimmunocompromised patients, those who were vaccinated had lower odds of death (aOR = 0.58) than did unvaccinated patients.§§§§ 

During the pre-Delta and Delta variant–predominant periods, immunocompromised patients generally had higher odds of death, irrespective of vaccination status compared with nonimmunocompromised patients, and nonimmunocompromised patients who were vaccinated had lower odds of death compared with unvaccinated patients (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118607). However, in the Omicron variant–predominant period, odds of death, irrespective of immunocompromise or vaccination status, were not statistically significantly different.","Once hospitalized, immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 had increased odds of ICU admission or in-hospital death, irrespective of vaccination status, compared with nonimmunocompromised patients, after adjusting for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics. The generally consistent association of individual immunocompromising conditions with increased odds of death suggests that immunocompromise itself was likely associated with severe outcomes. 

COVID-19 vaccination among immunocompromised persons is highly protective against COVID-19–associated hospitalization (3), leading to fewer hospitalized patients who are then admitted to the ICU or die in-hospital. Once patients were hospitalized, however, vaccination status was not associated with ICU admission or death among immunocompromised patients in these analyses; patients with more medical conditions likely had closer medical follow-up and were strongly advised to be vaccinated, biasing vaccinated patients to be those at higher risk for severe outcomes, potentially contributing to the absence of observed differences. In addition, vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes in immunocompromised persons is known to be lower than that in nonimmunocompromised persons (3,4). In comparison, nonimmunocompromised hospitalized patients who were vaccinated had reduced odds of death compared with those who were unvaccinated, consistent with the known protective effect of vaccination against severe outcomes in persons who can mount a robust immune response after vaccination. During the Omicron variant–predominant period, however, the effects of immunocompromise and vaccination on odds of death were attenuated in all patients, potentially due to the lower proportion of severe outcomes during hospitalization associated with this variant,¶¶¶¶ as well as the increased prevalence of previous infection-conferred immunity resulting in a decreased risk for infection across all groups and waning of vaccine-derived protection among those who received vaccine doses earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of these attenuated effects and the inability to further stratify by receipt of additional or booster doses because stratification generated unstable estimates (relative SE >30) in the analysis, the effect of additional or booster doses on death among immunocompromised patients was not able to be assessed. 

Data from population-based, active surveillance suggest that immunocompromised adults are overrepresented among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States, accounting for 12.2% of adult hospitalizations in COVID-NET compared with an estimated 2.7% of the U.S. adult population (5). However, immunocompromised patients in COVID-NET shared similar demographic characteristics with the underlying U.S. noninstitutionalized immunocompromised population. The age ranges with the highest percentages of immunocompromised patients were similar (COVID-NET: 50–74 years; U.S. population: 50–69 years) (5). The older age distribution among immunocompromised patients likely contributed to their higher prevalences of underlying conditions known to be associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes, including chronic lung disease, renal disease, and obesity, which would increase the likelihood of severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and inclusion in this analysis (6). 

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, the analyses did not control for time since vaccination; earlier eligibility for and receipt of vaccines by immunocompromised patients might have resulted in earlier waning of protection, complicating identification of associations between vaccination and severe outcomes. Second, whereas the active, population-based nature of COVID-NET data minimizes the risk for capturing a nonrepresentative sample of hospitalized patients, clinicians might have admitted immunocompromised patients who were less ill than were nonimmunocompromised patients, leading to smaller observed differences in severe outcomes. Third, the number of immunocompromised persons within COVID-NET catchment areas is unknown; therefore, population-based rates of severe outcomes by immunocompromise and vaccination status not conditioned on hospitalization could not be calculated. Finally, changing recommendations and absence of data on prehospitalization prophylactic or treatment medications for COVID-19 limited the ability to account for treatments; severe outcomes might have been mitigated in patients who received these medications. 

Given the increased odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes among immunocompromised hospitalized patients, multilayered prevention strategies for immunocompromised persons are critical to preventing hospitalization for COVID-19 and subsequent severe outcomes, especially when community levels indicate increased transmission and disease severity (7,8).***** These strategies include implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions; ensuring that immunocompromised persons and their close contacts are up to date with COVID-19 vaccination; urging immunocompromised persons to use effective preexposure prophylactic therapeutics, such as Evusheld; early testing, such as at-home tests; and early disease treatments, such as antiviral medications. Improved access to and use of these measures with considerations for socioeconomically disadvantaged and historically underserved racial and ethnic groups will help ensure health equity (9,10).†††††","Corresponding author: Jason Robert C.
